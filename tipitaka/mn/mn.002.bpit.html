<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-14'>14.</a></span> Thus have I heard:</p>

<p>Once the Bhag&#257;va<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1' title='Bhagava: "Exalted One".'>[1]</a> was staying at the Jetavana monastery of An&#257;thapi&#7751;&#7693;ika in S&#257;vatthi. At that time the Bhag&#257;va addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus!" And they answered him: "Venerable Sir!" Then the Bhag&#257;va uttered these words:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! I shall expound to you a discourse on the restraint of all &#257;savas.
	<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2' title='Asavas: defilements that befuddle the mind: They are like liquor long fermented. They convey the idea of something flowing out that intoxicates or befuddles the mind. Asavas are usually classified into four categories: (I) kamasava or gross attachment to ...'>[2]</a> Listen well and pay good attention. I shall speak."</p>

<p>"Very well, Venerable Sir!" replied the bhikkhus to the Bhag&#257;va, who [then] delivered this discourse.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-15'>15.</a></span> 
"Bhikkhus, I declare [that there is] the extinction of &#257;savas in one who knows and sees,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3' title='By "one who knows and sees" is meant one who knows and sees with right perception of phenomena. With the use of this expression and on the basis of what is meant by knowing and seeing, the Buddha refers to the person (who knows and sees). This Sutta is a ...'>[3]</a> and not in one who does not know and see. Bhikkhus! What is known and what is seen by one in whom I declare [that there is] the extinction of &#257;savas? The right perception of phenomena<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4' title='Right perception of phenomena: yonisomanasikara: lit., proper attention; proper consideration. Right perception of phenomena means perceiving all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable soulless and unpleasant.'>[4]</a> and the wrong perception of phenomena. Bhikkhus! In one who has wrong perception of phenomena there arise &#257;savas that have not yet arisen, and there also is an increase of &#257;savas that have already arisen. Bhikkhus, in one who has right perception of phenomena there is no arising of &#257;savas that have not yet arisen, and &#257;savas that have already arisen are also removed.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-16'>16.</a></span> 
"Bhikkhus! There are &#257;savas that should be removed through vision,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5' title='Vision: i.e., perception of Nibbana by means of Sotapatti magga.'>[5]</a> &#257;savas that should be removed through restraint, &#257;savas that should be removed through proper use [of requisites], &#257;savas that should be removed through forbearance, &#257;savas that should be removed through avoidance, &#257;savas that should be removed through rejection and &#257;savas that should be removed through cultivation [of the Factors of Enlightenment].</p>

<h3>&#256;savas that should be removed through vision</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-17'>17.</a></span> 
"Bhikkhus! What are the &#257;savas that should be removed through vision?</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! In the world the ignorant worldling,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6' title='"The ignorant worldling" means one who has not studied, who has not enquired into and who has not conned the Pali scriptures concerning khandha, ayatana etc., and who has not achieved through practice the dhammas that he should achieve.'>[6]</a> who is not in the habit of seeing<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-7' id='fnt-7' title='Who is not in the habit of seeing: What is meant here is seeing by means of the eye of wisdom and not seeing by means of the physical or by means of the divine eye (dibbacakkhu).'>[7]</a> the Ariyas,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8' id='fnt-8' title='The Buddha, Paccekabuddhas, and the Disciples of the Buddha who have attained one of the four maggas are termed Ariyas.'>[8]</a> who is not proficient in the dhamma of the Ariyas and who is not trained and disciplined<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9' id='fnt-9' title='Who is not trained and disciplined: one who has not yet been disciplined in the five kinds of restraint, who has not yet been taught and who has not yet cultivated the five kinds of removal of the defilements and who has not yet removed the defilements.'>[9]</a> in the dhamma of the Ariyas, who is not in the habit of seeing the Virtuous,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10' id='fnt-10' title='By "the Virtuous" (Sappurisa) is meant the Buddha, Paccekabuddhas and the Ariya Disciples of the Buddha.'>[10]</a> who is not proficient in the dhamma of the Virtuous and who is not trained and disciplined in the dhamma of the Virtuous, does not know the factors<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-11' id='fnt-11' title='Factors: i.e., dhammas.'>[11]</a>  which should be considered attentively and the factors which should not be considered attentively. Not discriminating the factors which should be considered attentively from the factors which should not be considered attentively, he considers attentively the factors which should not be considered and does not consider attentively the factors which should be considered.</p>

<p>"What are the factors <!-- (dhammas) --> which are considered attentively though they should not be considered?</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! In one who considers attentively certain factors [which should not be considered], there arises the defilement of sense-pleasure<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-12' id='fnt-12' title='Kamasava: the defilement of sense-pleasure; a gross attachment to and craving for the five sense-objects.'>[12]</a> that has not yet arisen, and there also is an increase of the defilement of sense-pleasure that has already arisen; there arises the defilement of hankering after better existence<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-13' id='fnt-13' title='Bhavasava: the defilement of hankering after better existence; craving for rupa and arupa planes of existence in the belief that they are permanent, stable and constant. This craving occurs together with sassata ditthi (belief in eternalism);.'>[13]</a> that has not yet arisen, and there also is an increase of the defilement of hankering after better existence that has already arisen; there arises the defilement of ignorance<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-14' id='fnt-14' title='Avijjasava: the defilement of ignorance; the defilement of ignorance (of the Four Ariya Truths).'>[14]</a> that has not yet arisen, and there also is an increase of the defilement of ignorance that has already arisen. These are the factors which are considered attentively [by an ignorant worldling] though they should not be considered.</p>

<p>"What are the factors <!-- (dhammas) --> which are not considered attentively though they should be considered?</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! In one who considers attentively certain factors [which should be considered], there does not arise the defilement of sense-pleasure that has not yet arisen, and the defilement of sense-pleasure also that has already arisen is removed; there does not arise the defilement of hankering after better existence that has not yet arisen, and the defilement of hankering after better existence also that has already arisen is removed; there does not arise the defilement of ignorance that has not yet arisen, and the defilement of ignorance also that has already arisen is removed. These are the factors which are not considered attentively [by an ignorant worldling] though they should be considered.</p>

<p>"Because such a person considers attentively the factors which should not be considered and does not consider attentively the factors which should be considered, there arise in him &#257;savas that have not yet arisen and there increase in him &#257;savas that have already arisen.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-18'>18.</a></span> 
"That person considers improperly thus: 'Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? Who was I in the past? How was I in the past?<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-15' id='fnt-15' title='I.e., of what appearance.'>[15]</a> In the past, who had been I and who was I [in the subsequent existence]? Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? Who will I be in the future? How <!-- (i.e., of what appearance) --> will I be in the future? In the future, having been who, who will I be?'<!-- [in the subsequent existence] --></p>

<p>"Also as regards the present, uncertainty arises in him thus: 'Do I exist? Do I not exist? Who am I? How <!-- (i.e., of what appearance) --> am I <!-- (i.e., is my soul) -->? From where has this soul come? Where will this soul go?'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-19'>19.</a></span> 
"In a person who thus considers improperly there arises one of the six [wrong] views<!--  (di&#7789;&#7789;hi) -->. The view 'I have self'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-16' id='fnt-16' title='Atta: self.'>[16]</a> arises in him really and firmly. Or, the view 'I have no self' arises in him really and firmly. Or, the view 'I perceive self through self' arises in him really and firmly. Or, the view 'I perceive non-self<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-17' id='fnt-17' title='Anatta: non-self.'>[17]</a> through self' arises in him really and firmly. Or, the view 'I perceive self through non-self' arises in him really and firmly. Or, he has the view thus: 'That self of mine speaks, knows and experiences the results of wholesome and unwholesome actions.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-18' id='fnt-18' title='I.e., in terms of birth, destination, and plane of beings.'>[18]</a> That self of mine is permanent, stable, durable, incorruptible and will be eternal like all things permanent.'</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! This wrong view is called a false belief, a jungle of false beliefs, a desert of false beliefs, a thorny spike of false beliefs, an agitation of false beliefs and a fetter of false beliefs. Bhikkhus! The ignorant worldling who is bound up with the fetter of false beliefs cannot escape rebirth, ageing, death, grief, lamentation, pain, distress and despair. I declare that he cannot escape dukkha.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-19' id='fnt-19' title='Both these paragraphs (&para;&para;18-19) teach at length the attending to of those dhammas which are not worthy of attention and the arising of the 16 kinds of uncertainty (vicikiccha) and of the 6 kinds of atta-ditthi.'>[19]</a></p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-20'>20.</a></span> "Bhikkhus! The instructed ariya disciple, who sees the Ariyas, who is skilled in their dhammas and who is trained and disciplined in their dhammas, who sees the Virtuous, who is skilled in their dhammas, and who is trained and disciplined in their dhammas, knows the factors <!-- (dhammas) --> which should be considered attentively and the factors which should not be considered attentively. Discriminating the factors which should be considered attentively from the factors which should not be considered attentively, he does not consider attentively the factors which should not be considered and considers attentively the factors which should be considered.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! What are the factors <!-- (dhammas) --> which are not considered attentively as they should not be considered?</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! In one who considers attentively certain factors [which should not be considered], there arises the defilement of sense-pleasure that has not yet arisen, and there also is an increase of the defilement of sense-pleasure that has already arisen; there arises the defilement of hankering after better existence that has not yet arisen, and there also is an increase of the defilement of hankering after better existence that has already arisen; there arises the defilement of ignorance that has not yet arisen, and there also is an increase of the defilement of ignorance that has already arisen. These are the factors which are not considered attentively [by the ariya disciple] as they should not be considered.</p>

These are the factors which are considered attentively [by the ariya disciple] as they should be considered.</p>

<p>"Because such a person does not consider attentively the factors which should not be considered and considers attentively the factors which should be considered, there do not arise in him &#257;savas that have not yet arisen and the &#257;savas that have already arisen disappear.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-21'>21.</a></span> 
"He considers properly: 'This is dukkha; this is the cause of dukkha; this is the cessation of dukkha; this is the practice <!-- (the Path) --> leading to cessation of dukkha.' In him who thus considers properly, the following three fetters disappear, namely, the illusion of Self,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20' id='fnt-20' title='Sakkayaditthi: illusion of Self in regard to the manifestation of one&#039;s khandhas or aggregates, as: "This is mine", "This is I", and "This is my Self".'>[20]</a>  uncertainty<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-21' id='fnt-21' title='Vicikicca: uncertainty concerning the Buddha, etc.'>[21]</a> and belief in the efficacy of mere rites and rituals.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-22' id='fnt-22' title='Silabbataparamasa: belief in the efficacy of mere rites and rituals as practiced outside the Ariya Path.'>[22]</a> These are called the &#257;savas which should be removed through vision.</p>

"Bhikkhus! What are the &#257;savas that are to be removed through forbearance?</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! In this Teaching, the bhikkhu, reflecting properly, can endure cold, heat, hunger, thirst, gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, heat of the sun, snakes, scorpions and lice. He can endure ill-spoken and unwholesome words. He has the nature of being able to endure severe, cruel, excruciatingly sharp, disagreeable, unpleasant, deadly and painful sensations which arise in the body.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! &#256;savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who cannot endure such painful sensations. Those &#257;savas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who endures such painful sensations with proper reflection. Bhikkhus! These are called the &#257;savas that are to be removed through forbearance.</p>

"Bhikkhus! What are the &#257;savas that are to be removed through avoidance?</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! In this Teaching, the bhikkhu, reflecting properly, avoids a fierce elephant, a fierce horse, a fierce ox, a fierce dog, a snake, a tree-stump, a thorny place, an abyss, a precipice, a refuse-pit and a cesspool. If a bhikkhu dwells in such an improper place, resorts to such an improper resort and keeps company with evil friends, his wise fellow-bhikkhus would suspect him of involving himself in evil circumstances. Reflecting properly, he avoids improper places, improper resorts and evil friends.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus! &#256;savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not avoid such improprieties with proper reflection. Those &#257;savas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who avoids such improprieties with proper reflection. Bhikkhus!

<dt><a href='#fnt-2' id='fn-2'>2</a>.</dt>
		<dd><p><em>&#256;savas:</em> defilements that befuddle the mind: They are like liquor long fermented. They convey the idea of something flowing out that intoxicates or befuddles the mind. &#256;savas are usually classified into four categories: (I) k&#257;m&#257;sava or gross attachment to and craving for the five sense-objects; (II) bhav&#257;sava or craving for better existence, such as the r&#363;pa and ar&#363;pa planes of existence in the belief that they are permanent, stable and constant; this craving occurs together with sassata di&#7789;&#7789;hi (belief in eternalism); (III) avijj&#257;sava or the defilement of lack of comprehension of the Four Ariya Truths through Magga Insight; (IV) di&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;sava or the defilement that is false belief.</p>
	<p>In this Sutta, however, the last is not mentioned. It may be taken as part of bhav&#257;sava.</p>
	<p>Although the &#257;savas are variously classified, they are basically only lobha (greed, desire), di&#7789;&#7789;hi (false belief) and moha (ignorance or bewilderment).</p></dd>

		<dd>By <em>"one who knows and sees"</em> is meant one who knows and sees with right perception of phenomena. With the use of this expression and on the basis of what is meant by knowing and seeing, the Buddha refers to the person (who knows and sees). This Sutta is a discourse taught with reference to the person and not the dhamma. [What is briefly said in this paragraph (<a href='#paragraph-15'>&para;15</a>) is that the one who knows and sees with right perception of phenomena is able to rid himself of the &#257;savas while the &#257;savas proliferate, for the one who does not know and see with right perception of phenomena.]</dd>

		<dd><p>The most crucial point in <a href='#paragraph-27'>&para;27</a> is the practice of the four Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;nas. It is the one and only way for the attainment of maggas and phalas and also for the realization of Nibb&#257;na. As a matter of fact, the Seven Bojjha&#7749;gas cannot take place without the practice of the four Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;nas.</p>
	<p>When a yog&#299; practices the Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;nas, he will achieve, first of all, mental concentration. When it becomes sufficiently strong, he will achieve, stage by stage, thirteen vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;as (insights), which will enable him to perceive the true nature of mind and body before he achieves maggas.</p>

	<p>Bojjha&#7749;gas are the factors of enlightenment which one must have while he is passing through these thirteen vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;as.</p>

	<p>Sati means mindfulness. Dhammavicaya means mindfulness of n&#257;ma (mind) and r&#363;pa (body) and their appearance and disappearance. V&#299;riya means diligence. P&#299;ti means the emotion of joy. Passadhi means composure. Sam&#257;dhi means mental concentration. Upekkh&#257; means equanimity.</p>

	<p>Briefly speaking, in the course of the practice of the Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;nas, if one knows he has the bojjha&#7749;gas hen he has them and knows he does not have them hen they disappear, and if he knows why he has them when he has them and why he does not have them when he has lost them, he is deemed to be a person who is endowed with these seven factors of enlightenment. And the Buddha taught that such a person is one who will pass through the vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;as and achieve maggas speedily.</p></dd>
