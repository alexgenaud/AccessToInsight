<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-042">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, these two bright principles protect the world. What are the two? Shame and fear of wrongdoing. If, bhikkhus, these two bright principles did not protect the world, there would not be discerned respect for mother or maternal aunt or maternal uncle's wife or a teacher's wife or the wives of other honored persons, and the world would have fallen into promiscuity, as with goats, sheep, chickens, pigs, dogs, and jackals. But as these two bright principles protect the world, there is discerned respect for mother... and the wives of other honored persons."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Those in whom shame and fear of wrong
Are not consistently found
Have deviated from the bright root
And are led back to birth and death.

But those in whom shame and fear of wrong
Are consistently ever present,
Peaceful, mature in the holy life,
They put an end to renewal of being.

<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-043">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"There is, bhikkhus, a not-born, a not-brought-to-being, a not-made, a not-conditioned. If, bhikkhus, there were no not-born, not-brought-to-being, not-made, not-conditioned, no escape would be discerned from what is born, brought-to-being, made, conditioned. But since there is a not-born, a not-brought-to-being, a not-made, a not-conditioned, therefore an escape is discerned from what is born, brought-to-being, made, conditioned."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
The born, come-to-be, produced,
The made, the conditioned, the transient,
Conjoined with decay and death,
A nest of disease, perishable,
Sprung from nutriment and craving's cord &mdash; 
That is not fit to take delight in.

The escape from that, the peaceful,
Beyond reasoning, everlasting,
The not-born, the unproduced,
The sorrowless state that is void of stain,
The cessation of states linked to suffering,
The stilling of the conditioned &mdash; bliss.

<h2><a id='iti-044'>&sect; 44. The Nibbana-element</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a> <span class='altID'>{Iti 2.17; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.038' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 38</a>}</span></h2>

<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-044">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, there are these two Nibbana-elements. What are the two? The Nibbana-element with residue left and the Nibbana-element with no residue left.</p>
<p>"What, bhikkhus, is the Nibbana-element with residue left? Here a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, the holy life fulfilled, who has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained the goal, destroyed the fetters of being, completely released through final knowledge. However, his five sense faculties remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable and feels pleasure and pain. It is the extinction of attachment, hate, and delusion in him that is called the Nibbana-element with residue left.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is the Nibbana-element with no residue left? Here a bhikkhu is an arahant... completely released through final knowledge. For him, here in this very life, all that is experienced, not being delighted in, will be extinguished. That, bhikkhus, is called the Nibbana-element with no residue left.</p>
<p>"These, bhikkhus, are the two Nibbana-elements."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
These two Nibbana-elements were made known
By the Seeing One, stable and unattached:
One is the element seen here and now
With residue, but with the cord of being destroyed;
The other, having no residue for the future,
Is that wherein all modes of being utterly cease.

Having understood the unconditioned state,
Released in mind with the cord of being destroyed,
They have attained to the Dhamma-essence.
Delighting in the destruction (of craving),
Those stable ones have abandoned all being.

<h2><a id='iti-049'>&sect; 49. Held by Views</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a> <span class='altID'>{Iti 2.22; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.043' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 43</a>}</span></h2>

<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-049">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, held by two kinds of views, some devas and<br />
 human beings hold back and some overreach; only those with vision see.</p>
<p>"And how, bhikkhus, do some hold back? Devas and humans enjoy being, delight in being, are satisfied with being. When Dhamma is taught to them for the cessation of being, their minds do not enter into it or acquire confidence in it or settle upon it or become resolved upon it. Thus, bhikkhus, do some hold back.</p>
<p>"How, bhikkhus, do some overreach? Now some are troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by this very same being and they rejoice in (the idea of) non-being, asserting: 'In as much as this self, good sirs, when the body perishes at death, is annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after death &mdash; this is peaceful, this is excellent, this is reality!' Thus, bhikkhus, do some overreach.</p>
<p>"How, bhikkhus, do those with vision see? Herein a bhikkhu sees what has come to be as having come to be. Having seen it thus, he practices the course for turning away, for dispassion, for the cessation of what has come to be. Thus, bhikkhus, do those with vision see."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Having seen what has come to be
As having come to be,
Passing beyond what has come to be,
They are released in accordance with truth
By exhausting the craving for being.

When a bhikkhu has fully understood
That which has come to be as such,
Free from craving to be this or that,
By the extinction of what has come to be
He comes no more to renewal of being.
</div>

<p>This too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord, so I heard.</p>
