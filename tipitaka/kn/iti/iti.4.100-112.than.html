<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "I am a brahman, responsive to requests, open-handed, bearing my last body, an unsurpassed doctor &amp; surgeon. You are my children, my sons, born from my mouth, born of the Dhamma, created by the Dhamma, heirs to the Dhamma, not heirs in material things.</p>
<p>"There are these two kinds of gifts: a gift of material things &amp; a gift of the Dhamma. Of the two, this is supreme: a gift of the Dhamma.</p>
<p>"There are these two kinds of sharing: sharing of material things &amp; sharing of the Dhamma. Of the two, this is supreme: sharing of the Dhamma.</p>
<p>"There are these two kinds of assistance: assistance with material things &amp; assistance with the Dhamma. Of the two, this is supreme: help with the Dhamma.</p>
<p>"There are these two kinds of mass-donations: a mass-donation of material things &amp; a mass-donation of the Dhamma. Of the two, this is supreme: a mass-donation of the Dhamma."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
He who, unstinting,
made the mass-donation of Dhamma,
the Tathagata,
sympathetic to all beings:
	to one of that sort
&mdash; the best of beings, human &amp; divine &mdash;
living beings pay homage &mdash;
	to one gone
	to the beyond
	of becoming.

Cast-off cloth is next to nothing, both easy to gain &amp; blameless. Alms food is next to nothing, both easy to gain &amp; blameless.

These are the four things that are next to nothing, both easy to gain &amp; blameless. When a monk is content with what is next to nothing, easy to gain &amp; blameless, then I say that he has one of the component factors of the contemplative life."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Content with what's blameless,
	next-to-nothing,
	easy to gain,
his mind not vexed
over	lodging, clothing,
	food, or drink:
the four directions offer him

congenial for the contemplative life,

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "For one knowing &amp; seeing, I tell you, there is the ending of fermentations, not for one not knowing &amp; seeing. For one knowing what &amp; seeing what is there the ending of fermentations? For one knowing &amp; seeing, 'This is stress,' there is the ending of fermentations. For one knowing &amp; seeing, 'This is the origination of stress,' there is the ending of fermentations.

For a learner in training
along the straight path, there arises:
first,		the knowledge of ending;
then,		the gnosis unsurpassed;
then,		the gnosis of one released &mdash;
release-knowledge, superlative,
the knowledge of ending:
	'The fetters are ended.'
Certainly not by the lazy fool
	uncomprehending,
is there attained
	Unbinding,
	the loosing of all ties.

<p>"By associating with monks of this sort, sharing with them, attending on them, the as-yet-unculminated aggregate of virtue goes to the culmination of its development, the as-yet-unculminated aggregate of concentration goes to the culmination of its development, the as-yet-unculminated aggregate of discernment goes to the culmination of its development, the as-yet-unculminated aggregate of release goes to the culmination of its development, the as-yet-unculminated aggregate of knowledge &amp; vision of release goes to the culmination of its development.

Either for the sake of cloth a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth. Or for the sake of alms food a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth.

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "Suppose a man was being carried along by the flow of a river, lovely &amp; alluring. And then another man with good eyesight, standing on the bank, on seeing him would say: 'My good man, even though you are being carried along by the flow of a river, lovely &amp; alluring, further down from here is a pool with waves &amp; whirlpools, with monsters &amp; demons. On reaching that pool you will suffer death or death-like pain.' Then the first man, on hearing the words of the second man, would make an effort with his hands &amp; feet to go against the flow.</p>
<p>"I have given you this simile to illustrate a meaning. The meaning is this: the flow of the river stands for craving. Lovely &amp; alluring stands for the six internal sense-media. The pool further down stands for the five lower fetters.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-109.1' id='fnt-109.1'>[1]</a> The waves stand for anger &amp; distress. The whirlpools stand for the five strings of sensuality. The monsters &amp; demons stand for the opposite sex. Against the flow stands for renunciation. Making an effort with hands &amp; feet stands for the arousing of persistence. The man with good eyesight standing on the bank stands for the Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Even if it's with pain,
you should abandon
sensual desires
if you aspire
to future safety from bondage.
	Alert,
with a mind well-released,
touch release now here,
	now there.
An attainer-of-wisdom,
having fulfilled the holy life,
is said to have gone
to the end of the world, gone
		beyond.

Whether walking, standing,
sitting, or lying down,
whoever thinks evil thoughts,
related to the household life,
	is following no path at all,
		smitten
with delusory things.
He's incapable,
	a monk like this,
of touching superlative
self-awakening.
But whoever &mdash;
walking, standing,
sitting, or lying down &mdash;
overcomes thought,
delighting in the stilling of thought:

self-awakening.

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "The world<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-112.1' id='fnt-112.1'>[1]</a> has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. From the world, the Tathagata is disjoined. The origination of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The origination of the world has, by the Tathagata, been abandoned. The cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The cessation of the world has, by the Tathagata, been realized. The path leading to the cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The path leading to the cessation of the world has, by the Tathagata, been developed.</p>
<p>"Whatever in this world &mdash; with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its generations complete with contemplatives &amp; brahmans, princes &amp; men &mdash; is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect, that has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. Thus he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"From the night the Tathagata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Self-awakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining, whatever the Tathagata has said, spoken, explained is just so <i>(tatha)</i> and not otherwise. Thus he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"The Tathagata is one who does in line with <i>(tatha)</i> what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does. Thus he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"In this world with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its generations complete with contemplatives &amp; brahmans, princes &amp; men, the <a id="epi112">Tathagata</a> is the unconquered conqueror, all-seeing, the wielder of power.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-112.2' id='fnt-112.2'>[2]</a> Thus he is called the Tathagata." <i>This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:</i></p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Directly knowing all the world,
all the world as is really is,
	from all the world	disjoined,
	in all the world	unmatched:
Conquering all
in all ways,
enlightened,
released from all bonds,
he touches the foremost peace &mdash;
	Unbinding, free
	from fear.

He is	free	of fermentation,
		of trouble,
	awakened,
		his doubts cut through;
has attained	the ending of action,
is released	in the destruction of acquisitions.
He is blessed, awakened,
a lion, unsurpassed.
In the world with its devas
he set the Brahma-wheel going.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-112.3' id='fnt-112.3'>[3]</a> 

Thus divine &amp; human beings
who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,
gathering, pay homage
<a id="mature112">to</a> the great one, thoroughly mature:

'<a id="tamed112">Tamed</a>, he's the best
	of those who can be tamed;
calm, the seer
	of those who can be calmed;
released, supreme
	among those who can be released;
crossed, the foremost
	of those who can cross.'

Thus they pay homage
to the great one, thoroughly mature:
'In this world with its devas,
	there's no one
	to compare
	with you.'
