In the Pali canon, this emotion is often accompanied by fear and a sensed need to escape from overwhelming danger. The things that should inspire urgency &amp; awe are the first four of the five reflections listed in <a href="../../an/an05/an05.057.than.html">AN 5.57</a>: "I am subject to aging, have not gone beyond aging. I am subject to illness, have not gone beyond illness. I am subject to death, have not gone beyond death. I will grow different, separate from all that is dear &amp; appealing to me." Appropriate exertion is indicated by the fifth reflection: "I am the owner of my actions, heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have by actions as my arbitrator.

<p>"You too should live enjoying seclusion, delighting in seclusion. To you &mdash; enjoying seclusion, delighting in seclusion &mdash; this thought will often occur: 'What is unskillful? What is not yet abandoned? What are we abandoning?'"</p>

To the Tathagata,
	awakened,
who endured what is hard to endure,
two thoughts occur:
	safety		the first thought mentioned;
	seclusion	the second declared.

The dispeller of darkness, free
of fermentation,
the great seer
who has		gone beyond,
		reached attainment,
	gained mastery,
crossed over the poisons;
	who's released in the ending of craving:

		that sage

bears his last body,
has shaken off <a id="mara38">Mara</a>, I tell you,
has gone	beyond aging.
<a id="rocky38">As one</a> standing on a rocky crag

	conquered by aging &amp; death.

Any bad destinations
in this world, in the next,
are rooted in ignorance &mdash; all &mdash;
	accumulations

And when a person of evil desires
lacks conscience &amp; respect,
evil comes from that,
and by that he goes
to deprivation.

So cleansing away
ignorance, desire, &amp; greed,
a monk giving rise to clear knowing
would abandon all bad destinations.
