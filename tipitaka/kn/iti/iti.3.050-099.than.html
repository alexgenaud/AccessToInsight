<div class='freeverse'>
Comprehending the property of form,

those released in cessation
are people who've left death		behind.

Having touched with his body

	<dd>The property of form corresponds to the experience of the form of the body as present in the first four levels of jhana (see <a href="iti.intro.than.html#glossary">Glossary</a>). The property of formlessness corresponds to the formless experiences based on the fourth level of jhana: the dimension of the infinitude of space, the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. The property of cessation is the experience of the total cessation of stress.</dd>

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i></p>
<p>"When a deva is about to pass away from the company of devas, five omens appear: his garlands wither, his clothes get soiled, sweat comes out of his armpits, a dullness descends on his body, he no longer delights in his own deva-seat. The devas, knowing from this that 'This deva-son is about to pass away,' encourage him with three sayings: 'Go from here, honorable sir, to a good destination. Having gone to a good destination, gain the gain that is good to gain. Having gained the gain that is good to gain, become well-established.'"</p>
<p><a id="devas83">When</a> this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, "What, lord, is the devas' reckoning of going to a good destination? What is their reckoning of the gain that is good to gain? What is their reckoning of becoming well-established?"</p>
<p>"The human state, monks, is the devas' reckoning of going to a good destination. Having become a human being, acquiring conviction in the Dhamma-&amp;-Vinaya taught by the Tathagata: this is the devas' reckoning of the gain that is good to gain. When that conviction is settled within one &mdash; rooted, established, &amp; strong, not to be destroyed by any brahman or contemplative; deva, Mara, or Brahma; or anyone else in the world: this is the devas' reckoning of becoming well-established."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
When a deva passes away
from the company of devas
through his life-span's ending,
three sounds sound forth
	&mdash; the devas' encouragement.

	'Go from here,
	honorable sir,
to a good destination,
to companionship
with human beings.
On becoming a human being,
acquire a conviction
unsurpassed
	in True Dhamma.
That conviction of yours
in True Dhamma, well-taught,
should be	settled,
		rooted,
		established,
&mdash; undestroyed
as long as you live.
Having abandoned
	bodily misconduct,
	verbal misconduct,
	mental misconduct,
and whatever else is flawed;
having done with the body what's skillful,
and much that is skillful with speech,
having done what's skillful
with a heart without limit,
	with no acquisitions,
then &mdash; having made much
of that basis of merit
through giving &mdash;
establish other mortals
in	True Dhamma &amp;
	the holy life.'

With this sympathy, the devas &mdash;
when they know a deva is passing away &mdash;
encourage him:
		'Come back, deva,
		again &amp; again.'

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "This is a lowly means of livelihood, alms gathering. It's a form of abuse in the world [to say], 'You go around as an alms gatherer with a bowl in your hand!' Yet sensible young men of good families have taken it up for a compelling reason. They have not been forced into it by kings or robbers, nor through debt, through fear, nor through the loss of their livelihood, but through the thought: 'We are beset by birth, aging, &amp; death, by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs, beset by stress, overcome with stress. O, that the end of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress might be known!' But this young man of good family, having gone forth in this way, may be greedy for sensual pleasures, strong in his passions, malevolent in mind, corrupt in his resolves, his mindfulness muddled, unalert, uncentered, his mind scattered, &amp; his faculties uncontrolled. <a id="firebrand91">Just as</a> a firebrand from a funeral pyre &mdash; burning at both ends, covered with excrement in the middle &mdash; is used as fuel neither in a village nor in the wilderness: I tell you that this is a simile for this person. He has missed out on the householder's enjoyments and does not fulfill the purpose of the contemplative life."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
	He's missed out
on the householder's enjoyment
&amp; the purpose of the contemplative life
	&mdash; unfortunate man!
Ruining it, he throws it away,
	perishes
like a firebrand used at a funeral.
<a id="iron91">Better</a> to eat an iron ball
&mdash; glowing, aflame &mdash;
than that, unprincipled &amp;
	unrestrained,
he should eat the alms of the country.

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "Even if a monk, taking hold of my outer cloak, were to follow right behind me, placing his feet in my footsteps, yet if he were to be greedy for sensual pleasures, strong in his passions, malevolent in mind, corrupt in his resolves, his mindfulness muddled, unalert, uncentered, his mind scattered, &amp; his faculties uncontrolled, then he would be far from me, and I from him.

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "Monks, there are these three fires. Which three? The fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. These, monks, are the three fires."</p>

Not understanding these fires, people
	&mdash; fond of self-identity &mdash;
	unreleased from Mara's shackles,
swell the ranks of hell,

	the realm of the hungry shades.

While those who, day &amp; night,
are devoted
to the teachings
	of the rightly self-awakened,
put out the fire of passion,
	constantly perceiving the foul.
They, superlative people,
put out the fire of aversion
		with good will,
and the fire of delusion
	with the discernment leading
	to penetration.
They, the masterful, untiring by day &amp; night,

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "It's on the strength of Dhamma that I describe [a person as] a brahman with threefold knowledge, and not another as measured by citing &amp; reciting. And how is it on the strength of Dhamma that I describe [a person as] a brahman with threefold knowledge, and not another as measured by citing &amp; reciting?</p>
<p>"There is the case where a monk recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance.
