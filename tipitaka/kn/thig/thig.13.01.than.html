<div class='freeverse'>
Black was my hair
&mdash; the color of bees &mdash;
&amp; curled at the tips;
	with age, it looked like coarse hemp.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Fragrant, like a perfumed basket
filled with flowers:
	With age it smelled musty,
	like animal fur.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Thick &amp; lush, like a well-tended grove,
made splendid, the tips elaborate
with comb &amp; pin.
	With age, it grew thin
	&amp; bare here &amp; there.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Adorned with gold &amp; delicate pins,
it was splendid, ornamented with braids.
	Now, with age,
	that head has gone bald.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Curved, as if well-drawn by an artist,
my brows were once splendid.
	With age, they droop down in folds.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Radiant, brilliant like jewels,
my eyes:
	With age, they're no longer splendid.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Like a delicate peak, my nose
was splendid in the prime of my youth.
	With age, it's like a long pepper.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Like bracelets &mdash; well-fashioned, well-finished &mdash;
my ears were once splendid.
	With age, they droop down in folds.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Like plaintain buds in their color,
my teeth were once splendid.
	With age, they're broken &amp; yellowed.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Like that of a cuckoo in the dense jungle,
flitting through deep forest thickets:
sweet was the tone of my voice.
	With age, it cracks here &amp; there.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Smooth &mdash; like a conch shell well-polished &mdash;
my neck was once splendid.
	With age, it's broken down, bent.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Like rounded door-bars &mdash; both of them &mdash;
my arms were once splendid.
	With age, they're like dried up patali trees.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Adorned with gold &amp; delicate rings,
my hands were once splendid.
	With age, they're like onions &amp; tubers.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Swelling, round, firm, &amp; high,
both my breasts were once splendid.
	In the drought of old age, they dangle
	like empty old water bags.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Like a sheet of gold, well-burnished,
my body was splendid.
	Now it's covered with very fine wrinkles.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Smooth in their lines, like an elephant's trunk,
both my thighs were once splendid.
	With age, they're like knotted bamboo.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Adorned with gold &amp; delicate anklets,
my calves were once splendid.
	With age, they're like sesame sticks.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

As if they were stuffed with soft cotton,
both my feet were once splendid.
	With age, they're shriveled &amp; cracked.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.

Such was this physical heap,
now:
	A house with its plaster all fallen off.
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words
		doesn't change.
