<h1><a id='pr'>P&#257;r&#257;jika: Rules entailing expulsion from the Sangha (Defeat)</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p><b><a id="pr-1">1.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu &mdash; participating in the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus, without having renounced the training, without having declared his weakness &mdash; engage in sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><b><a id="pr-2">2.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness &mdash; just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish him, saying, "You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief" &mdash; a bhikkhu in the same way taking what is not given also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><b><a id="pr-3">3.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><b><a id="pr-4">4.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu, without direct knowledge, claim a superior human state, a truly noble knowledge and vision, as present in himself, saying, "Thus do I know; thus do I see," such that regardless of whether or not he is cross-examined on a later occasion, he &mdash; being remorseful and desirous of purification &mdash; might say, "Friends, not knowing, I said I know; not seeing, I said I see &mdash; vainly, falsely, idly," unless it was from over-estimation, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h1><a id='sg'>Sa&#7749;gh&#257;disesa: Rules entailing an initial and subsequent meeting of the Sangha</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p><b><a id="sg-1">1.</a></b>  Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-2">2.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, engage in bodily contact with a woman, or in holding her hand, holding a lock of her hair, or caressing any of her limbs, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-3">3.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, address lewd words to a woman in the manner of young men to a young woman alluding to sexual intercourse, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-4">4.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, speak in the presence of a woman in praise of ministering to his own sensuality thus: "This, sister, is the foremost ministration, that of ministering to a virtuous, fine-natured follower of the celibate life such as myself with this act" &mdash; alluding to sexual intercourse &mdash; it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-5">5.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu engage in conveying a man's intentions to a woman or a woman's intentions to a man, proposing marriage or paramourage &mdash; even if only for a momentary liaison &mdash; it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-6">6.</a></b>  When a bhikkhu is having a hut built from (gains acquired by) his own begging &mdash; having no sponsor and destined for himself &mdash; he is to have it built to the standard measurement. Here the standard is this: twelve spans, using the sugata span, in length (measuring outside); seven in width, (measuring) inside. Bhikkhus are to be assembled to designate the site. The site the bhikkhus designate should be without disturbances and with adequate space. If the bhikkhu should have a hut built from his own begging on a site with disturbances and without adequate space, or if he should not assemble the bhikkhus to designate the site, or if he should have the standard exceeded, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-7">7.</a></b>  When a bhikkhu is having a large dwelling built &mdash; having a sponsor and destined for himself &mdash; he is to assemble bhikkhus to designate the site. The site the bhikkhus designate should be without disturbances and with adequate space. If the bhikkhu should have a large dwelling built on a site with disturbances and without adequate space, or if he should not assemble the bhikkhus to designate the site, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-8">8.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu &mdash; corrupt, aversive, disgruntled &mdash; charge a bhikkhu with an unfounded case entailing defeat, (thinking), "Perhaps I may bring about his fall from this celibate life," then regardless of whether or not he is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue is unfounded and the bhikkhu confesses his aversion, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-9">9.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu &mdash;  corrupt, aversive, disgruntled &mdash;  using as a mere ploy an aspect of an issue that pertains otherwise, charge a bhikkhu with a case entailing defeat, (thinking), "Perhaps I may bring about his fall from this celibate life," then regardless of whether or not he is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue pertains otherwise, an aspect used as a mere ploy, and the bhikkhu confesses his aversion, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-10">10.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu agitate for a schism in a united Community, or should he persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism, the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "Do not, venerable sir, agitate for a schism in a united Community or persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable one be reconciled with the Community, for a united Community, on courteous terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, dwells in peace."</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times for the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times he relinquishes that, that is good. If he does not relinquish (that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-11">11.</a></b>  Should bhikkhus &mdash; one, two, or three &mdash; who are followers and partisans of that bhikkhu, say, "Do not, venerable sirs, admonish that bhikkhu in any way. He is an exponent of the Dhamma. He is an exponent of the Vinaya. He acts with our consent and approval. He knows, he speaks for us, and that is pleasing to us," the bhikkhus are to admonish them thus: "Do not say that, venerable sirs. That bhikkhu is not an exponent of the Dhamma and he is not an exponent of the Vinaya. Do not, venerable sirs, approve of a schism in the Community. Let the venerable ones' (minds) be reconciled with the Community, for a united Community, on courteous terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, dwells in peace."</p>

<p>And should those bhikkhus, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke them up to three times for the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times they relinquish that, that is good. If they do not relinquish (that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-12">12.</a></b>  In case a bhikkhu is by nature difficult to admonish &mdash; who, when being legitimately admonished by the bhikkhus with reference to the training rules included in the (P&#257;&#7789;imokkha) recitation, makes himself unadmonishable, (saying,) "Do not, venerable ones, say anything to me, good or bad; and I won't say anything to the venerable ones, good or bad. Refrain, venerable ones, from admonishing me" &mdash; the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "Let the venerable one not make himself unadmonishable. Let the venerable one make himself admonishable. Let the venerable one admonish the bhikkhus in accordance with what is right, and the bhikkhus will admonish the venerable one in accordance with what is right; for it is thus that the Blessed One's following is nurtured: through mutual admonition, through mutual rehabilitation."</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times for the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times he relinquishes that, that is good. If he does not relinquish (that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-13">13.</a></b>  In case a bhikkhu living in dependence on a certain village or town is a corrupter of families, a man of depraved conduct &mdash; whose depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families he has corrupted are both seen and heard about &mdash; the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "You, venerable sir, are a corrupter of families, a man of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, venerable sir. Enough of your staying here."</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, say about the bhikkhus, "The bhikkhus are biased through favoritism, biased through aversion, biased through delusion, biased through fear, in that for this sort of offense they banish some and do not banish others," the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "Do not say that, venerable sir. The bhikkhus are not biased through favoritism, are not biased through aversion, are not biased through delusion, are not biased through fear. You, venerable sir, are a corrupter of families, a man of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, venerable sir. Enough of your staying here."</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times for the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times he relinquishes that, that is good. If he does not relinquish (that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<h1><a id='ay'>Aniyata: Indefinite rules</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>

<p><b><a id="ay-1">1.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu sit in private, alone with a woman on a seat secluded enough to lend itself (to sexual intercourse), so that a female lay follower whose word can be trusted, having seen (them), might describe it as constituting any of three cases &mdash; entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession &mdash; then the bhikkhu, acknowledging having sat (there), may be dealt with in line with any of the three cases &mdash; entailing defeat, communal meetings, or confession &mdash; or he may be dealt with for whichever case the female lay follower whose word can be trusted described. This case is indefinite.</p>

<p><b><a id="ay-2">2.</a></b>  In case a seat is not sufficiently secluded to lend itself (to sexual intercourse) but sufficiently so to address lewd words to a woman, should any bhikkhu sit in private, alone with a woman on such a seat, so that a female lay follower whose word can be trusted, having seen (them), might describe it as constituting either of two cases &mdash; entailing communal meetings or confession &mdash; then the bhikkhu, acknowledging having sat (there), may be dealt with in line with either of the two cases &mdash; entailing communal meetings or confession &mdash; or he is to be dealt with in line with whichever case the female lay follower whose word can be trusted described. This case too is indefinite.</p>

<h1><a id='np'>Nissaggiya P&#257;cittiya: Rules entailing forfeiture and confession</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<h2><a id='np-part1'>Part One: The Robe-cloth Chapter</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#np'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p><b><a id="np-1">1.</a></b>  When a bhikkhu has finished his robe and the frame is dismantled (his kathina privileges are ended), he is to keep extra robe-cloth ten days at most. Beyond that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-2">2.</a></b>  When a bhikkhu has finished his robe and the frame is dismantled (his kathina privileges are ended): If he dwells apart from (any of) his three robes even for one night &mdash; unless authorized by the bhikkhus &mdash; it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-3">3.</a></b>  When a bhikkhu has finished his robe and the frame is dismantled (his kathina privileges are ended): Should out-of-season robe-cloth accrue to him, he may accept it if he so desires. Having accepted it, he is to make it up immediately (into a cloth requisite). If it should not be enough, he may lay it aside for a month at most when he has an expectation for filling the lack. If he should keep it beyond that, even when he has an expectation (for further cloth), it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-4">4.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu have a used robe washed, dyed, or beaten by a bhikkhun&#299; unrelated to him, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-5">5.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu accept robe-cloth from the hand of a bhikkhun&#299; unrelated to him &mdash; except in exchange &mdash; it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-6">6.</a></b>  Should any bhikkhu ask for robe-cloth from a man or woman householder unrelated to him, except at the proper occasion, it is to be forfeited and confessed. Here the proper occasion is this: The bhikkhu's robe has been snatched away or destroyed. This is the proper occasion here.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-7">7.</a></b>  If that unrelated man or woman householder presents the bhikkhu with many robes (pieces of robe-cloth), he is to accept at most (enough for) an upper and a lower robe. If he accepts more than that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-8">8.</a></b>  In case a man or woman householder unrelated (to&nbsp; the bhikkhu) prepares a robe fund for the sake of a bhikkhu, thinking, "Having purchased a robe with this robe fund, I will clothe the bhikkhu named so-and-so with a robe": If the bhikkhu, not previously invited, approaching (the householder) should make a stipulation with regard to the robe, saying, "It would be good indeed, sir, if you clothed me (with a robe), having purchased a robe of such-and-such a sort with this robe fund" &mdash; out of a desire for something fine &mdash; it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-9">9.</a></b>  In case two householders &mdash; men or women &mdash; unrelated (to the bhikkhu) prepare separate robe funds for the sake of a bhikkhu, thinking, "Having purchased separate robes with these separate robe funds of ours, we will clothe the bhikkhu named so-and-so with robes": If the bhikkhu, not previously invited, approaching (them) should make a stipulation with regard to the robe, saying, "It would be good indeed, sirs, if you clothed me (with a robe), having purchased a robe of such-and-such a sort with these separate robe funds, the two (funds) together for one (robe)" &mdash; out of a desire for something fine &mdash; it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

I acknowledge it."</p>

<p><b><a id="pd-2">2.</a></b>  In case bhikkhus, being invited, are eating in family residences, and if a bhikkhun&#299; is standing there as though giving directions, (saying,) "Give curry here, give rice here," then the bhikkhus are to dismiss her: "Go away, sister, while the bhikkhus are eating." If not one of the bhikkhus should speak to dismiss her, "Go away, sister, while the bhikkhus are eating," the bhikkhus are to acknowledge it: "Friends, we have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that ought to be acknowledged. We acknowledge it."</p>

<p><b><a id="pd-3">3.</a></b>  There are families designated as in training. Should any bhikkhu, not being ill, uninvited beforehand, chew or consume staple or non-staple food, having received it himself at the residences of families designated as in training, he is to acknowledge it: "Friends, I have committed a blameworthy, unsuitable act that ought to be acknowledged.

<div class="chapter">
<h1><a id='as'>Adhikara&#7751;a-Samatha: Rules for settling disputes</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p><b><a id="as-1">1.</a></b> <i>A face-to-face verdict should be given.</i> This means that the formal act settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community, in the presence of the individuals, and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

<p><b><a id="as-2">2.</a></b> <i>A verdict of mindfulness may be given.</i> This is the verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that he did not commit the offense in question.</p>

<p><b><a id="as-3">3.</a></b> <i>A verdict of past insanity may be given.</i> This is another verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused was out of his mind when he committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any responsibility for it.</p>

<p><b><a id="as-4">4.</a></b> <i>Acting in accordance with what is admitted.</i> This refers to the ordinary confession of offenses, where no formal interrogation is involved. The confession is valid only if in accord with the facts, e.g., a bhikkhu actually commits a p&#257;cittiya offense and then confesses it as such, and not as a stronger or lesser offense. If he were to confess it as a dukkata or a sa&#7749;gh&#257;disesa, that would be invalid.</p>

<p><b><a id="as-5">5.</a></b> <i>Acting in accordance with the majority.</i> This refers to cases in which bhikkhus are unable to settle a dispute unanimously, even after all the proper procedures are followed, and  &mdash;  in the words of the Canon  &mdash;  are &quot;wounding one another with weapons of the tongue.&quot; In cases such as these, decisions can be made by majority vote.</p>

<p><b><a id="as-6">6.</a></b> <i>Acting for his (the accused's) further punishment.</i> This refers to cases where a bhikkhu admits to having committed the offense in question only after being formally interrogated about it. He is then to be reproved for his actions, made to remember the offense, and to confess it. After that the Community imposes the further punishment of a Community transaction that requires him to forfeit a long list of his normal rights as a bhikkhu for a period of time until they are satisfied that he has taken the lesson to heart.</p>

<p><b><a id="as-7">7.</a></b> <i>Covering over as with grass.</i> This refers to situations in which both sides of a dispute realize that, in the course of their dispute, they have done much that is unworthy of a contemplative. If they were to deal with one another for their offenses, the only result would be greater divisiveness. Thus if both sides agree, all the bhikkhus gather in one place. (According to the Commentary, this means that all bhikkhus in the <i>sima</i> must attend. No one should send his consent, and even sick bhikkhus must go.) A motion is made to the entire group that this procedure will be followed. One member of each side then makes a formal motion to the members of his faction that he will make a confession for them. When both sides are ready, the representative of each side addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession, using the form of a motion and one announcement (<i>natti-dutiya-kamma</i>).</p>
