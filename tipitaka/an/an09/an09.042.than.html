<div class="chapter">
<p>On one occasion <a id="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> was staying in <a id="kosambi">Kosambi</a> at Ghosita's Park. Then <a id="udayin">Ven. Udayin</a> went to him and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Ananda, "This has been said by Pa&ntilde;calacanda the deva's son:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
'In a confining place, he found an opening &mdash;
the one of extensive wisdom,
the awakened one who awakened to jhana,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a>
		the chief bull, withdrawn,
		the sage.'
</div>


<p>"Now which, my friend, is the confining place? And which opening in the confining place is the Blessed One said to have attained?"</p>

<p>[Ven. Ananda:] "The five strings of sensuality, my friend, are described by the Blessed One as a confining place. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing; sounds cognizable via the ear... smells cognizable via the nose... tastes cognizable via the tongue... tactile sensations cognizable via the body &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. These five strings of sensuality are described by the Blessed One as a confining place.</p>

<p>"Now there is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>directed thought &amp; evaluation</i> have not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>rapture</i> has not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>the pleasure of equanimity</i> has not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; stress &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>the perception of form</i> has not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, [perceiving,] 'Infinite space,' enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space</i> has not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, [perceiving,] 'Infinite consciousness,' enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness</i> has not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, [perceiving,] 'There is nothing,' enters &amp; remains in the dimension of nothingness. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>the perception of the dimension of nothingness</i> has not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, enters &amp; remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel. For even there there's a confining place. What is the confining place there? Just that <i>the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception</i> has not ceased. This is the confining place there.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters &amp; remains in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling. And, having seen [that] with discernment, his mental fermentations are completely ended. Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, without a sequel."</p>

<p><a id="strings5"></a>"There are these five strings of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye  &mdash;  agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing; sounds cognizable via the ear... aromas cognizable via the nose... flavors cognizable via the tongue... tactile sensations cognizable via the body  &mdash;  agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. But these are not sensuality. They are called strings of sensuality in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
The passion for his resolves is a man's sensuality,
not the beautiful sensual pleasures
	found in the world.
The passion for his resolves is a man's sensuality.

The beauties remain as they are in the world,
while the wise, in this regard,
	subdue their desire."
