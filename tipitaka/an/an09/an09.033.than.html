<p>"Monks, I will teach you the nine step-by-step dwelling-attainments. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

<p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>

<p>The Blessed One said, "And what, monks, are the nine step-by-step dwelling-attainments?</p>

<p>[1] "Wherever sensual resolves cease and those who repeatedly are stopping sensual resolves dwell: Surely, I tell you, by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger, unbound, having crossed over &amp; gone to the far shore.</p>

<p>"Now if someone should say, 'Where do sensual resolves cease? And where do those who repeatedly are stopping sensual resolves dwell? I don't know that; I don't see that,' he should be told, 'There is the case, friend, where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jh&#257;na: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. That is where sensual resolves cease, and where those who repeatedly are stopping sensual resolves dwell.' Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) 'Very good,' would delight in &amp; approve of that statement. Delighting in &amp; approving of that statement, paying homage &amp; raising his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he would honor it.</p>

<p>[2] "Wherever directed thoughts &amp; evaluations cease and those who repeatedly are stopping directed thoughts &amp; evaluations dwell: Surely, I tell you, by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger, unbound, having crossed over &amp; gone to the far shore.</p>

<p>"Now if someone should say, 'Where do directed thoughts &amp; evaluations cease? And where do those who repeatedly are stopping directed thoughts &amp; evaluations dwell? I don't know that; I don't see that,' he should be told, 'There is the case, friend, where a monk, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enters &amp; remains in the second jh&#257;na: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. That is where directed thoughts &amp; evaluations cease, and where those who repeatedly are stopping directed thoughts &amp; evaluations dwell.' Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) 'Very good,' would delight in &amp; approve of that statement. Delighting in &amp; approving of that statement, paying homage &amp; raising his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he would honor it.</p>

<p>[3] "Wherever rapture ceases and those who repeatedly are stopping rapture dwell: Surely, I tell you, by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger, unbound, having crossed over &amp; gone to the far shore.</p>

<p>"Now if someone should say, 'Where does rapture cease? And where do those who repeatedly are stopping rapture dwell? I don't know that; I don't see that,' he should be told, 'There is the case, friend, where a monk, with the fading of rapture, remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jh&#257;na, of which the noble ones declare, "Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding." That is where rapture ceases, and where those who repeatedly are stopping rapture dwell.' Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) 'Very good,' would delight in &amp; approve of that statement. Delighting in &amp; approving of that statement, paying homage &amp; raising his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he would honor it.</p>

<p>"Now if someone should say, 'Where does the pleasure of equanimity cease? And where do those who repeatedly are stopping the pleasure of equanimity dwell? I don't know that; I don't see that,' he should be told, 'There is the case, friend, where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of joy &amp; distress &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the fourth jh&#257;na: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. That is where the pleasure of equanimity ceases, and where those who repeatedly are stopping the pleasure of equanimity dwell.' Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) 'Very good,' would delight in &amp; approve of that statement.

		<dd>In <a href='an09.034.than.html'>AN 9.34</a>, the "affliction" of the third jh&#257;na that is abandoned in the fourth jh&#257;na is said to be equanimity. However, the fourth jh&#257;na also contains equanimity. Thus the statement in this sutta &mdash; that the <i>pleasure</i> of equanimity is abandoned in the fourth jh&#257;na &mdash; seems more consistent with the fourth jh&#257;na as described in the standard formula. <a href='an09.042.than.html'>AN 9.42</a> is in agreement with this sutta on this point.</dd>
