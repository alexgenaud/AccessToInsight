<p>"Monks, there are these <a id="yokes4">four yokes</a>. Which four? The yoke of sensuality, the yoke of becoming, the yoke of views, &amp; the yoke of ignorance.</p>

There is the case where a certain person does not discern, as it actually is present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, &amp; the escape from sensuality. When he does not discern, as it actually is present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, &amp; the escape from sensuality, then &mdash; with regard to sensual objects &mdash; he is obsessed with sensual passion, sensual delight, sensual attraction, sensual infatuation, sensual thirst, sensual fever, sensual fascination, sensual craving. This is the yoke of sensuality.</p>
<p>"And how is there the yoke of <a id="becoming">becoming</a>? <!-- jtb 2010.03.24: This and subsequent paragraphs begin "And how is there...", whereas the previous one begins "And what is...". This is correct. AG tells me that the Pali source itself is inconsistent. --> There is the case where a certain person does not discern, as it actually is present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, &amp; the escape from becoming.

<div class='freeverse'>
Joined with the yoke of sensuality
	&amp; the yoke of becoming,
joined with the yoke of views,
	surrounded by ignorance,
beings go to the wandering-on,
	heading to birth
		&amp; death.
But those who comprehend sensuality
	&amp; the yoke of becoming &mdash; entirely &mdash;
who have thrown off the yoke of views
	and are dispassionate
	toward ignorance,
disjoined from all yokes:
they &mdash; their yokes overcome &mdash;
		are sages
		indeed.
