<dt><a href='#fnt-1' id='fn-1'>1</a>.</dt>
		<dd>This statement refers to the P&#257;&#7789;imokkha recitation, which contains 227 rules. Some have argued that this statement is proof that the P&#257;&#7789;imokkha currently contains some rules that it did not contain in the Buddha's time. However, this assertion ignores two points: (a) The sutta texts are notoriously vague about large numbers, and &mdash; given their manner in reporting large numbers &mdash; "more than 150" could cover anything from 150 to 250 rules. (b) The Buddha added rules to the P&#257;&#7789;imokkha over the course of many years. This sutta may have taken place earlier in his life before the P&#257;&#7789;imokkha had reached its current size.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-2' id='fn-2'>2</a>.</dt>
		<dd>For definitions of these trainings, see <a href='an03.088.than.html'>AN 3.88</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-3' id='fn-3'>3</a>.</dt>
		<dd>According to the Commentary, this category of non-returner first appears spontaneously in any of the first four levels of the five Pure Abodes &mdash; among the Aviha (Not Falling Away) devas, the Atappa (Untroubled) devas, the Sudassa (Good-looking) devas, or the Sudass&#299; (Clear-seeing) devas &mdash; and then appears spontaneously in progressively higher levels until reaching the highest, the Akani&#7789;&#7789;ha (Peerless) Pure Abode, there to be unbound.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-4' id='fn-4'>4</a>.</dt>
		<dd><p>The Commentary defines this category and the following one with this example: Suppose that a non-returner appears spontaneously in the Aviha (Not Falling Away) Pure Abode, where the lifespan is 1,000 eons. If he/she attains unbinding after the first 100 eons, he/she is classed as one unbound on arrival. If he/she attains unbinding anywhere from between the first day in that Pure Abode up through the first 400 eons, he/she is classed as one unbound in between. For a non-returner appearing spontaneously in any of the higher Pure Abodes, where the lifespans get progressively longer, the same proportions would hold.</p>

<p>This way of classifying these two categories, however, doesn't make much sense for two reasons. (a) The sutta lists the categories in ascending order, and there's little reason to class one who takes 400 eons to attain unbinding higher than one who takes only 100 eons to do so. (b) The second category actually includes the first, so there would seem to be little reason to distinguish them as two separate categories.</p>

<p>It would make better sense to define the categories this way: One who attains unbinding relatively soon after arriving in a Pure Abode is one unbound on arrival. One who attains unbinding after leaving the human realm but before reaching a Pure Abode would be one unbound in between.</p></dd>
