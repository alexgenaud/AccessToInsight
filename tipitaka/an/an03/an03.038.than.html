<p><b>Translator's note:</b> The Pali Text Society editions treat this discourse as two discourses &mdash; III.38 &amp; III.39 &mdash; divided at the <a href="#asterisk">triple asterisk</a>. Asian editions treat it as one, numbered III.39. The autobiographical verse at the end of the second half &mdash; which is identical with the verse concluding <a href="../an05/an05.057.than.html">AN 5.57</a> &mdash; fits neatly with the autobiographical first half of the discourse, suggesting that the two halves were meant to go together.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>"Monks, I lived in refinement, utmost refinement, total refinement. My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace: one where red-lotuses bloomed, one where white lotuses bloomed, one where blue lotuses bloomed, all for my sake. I used no sandalwood that was not from Varanasi. My turban was from Varanasi, as were my tunic, my lower garments, &amp; my outer cloak. A white sunshade was held over me day &amp; night to protect me from cold, heat, dust, dirt, &amp; dew.</p>
<p>"I had <a id="palaces3">three palaces</a>: one for the cold season, one for the hot season, one for the rainy season. During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainy-season palace by minstrels without a single man among them, and I did not once come down from the palace. Whereas the servants, workers, &amp; retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup &amp; broken rice, in my father's home the servants, workers, &amp; retainers were fed wheat, rice, and meat.</p>
<p>"Even though I was endowed with such fortune, such total refinement, the thought occurred to me: 'When an untaught, run-of-the-mill person, himself subject to aging, not beyond aging, sees another who is aged, he is horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted, oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging, not beyond aging. If I &mdash; who am subject to aging, not beyond aging &mdash; were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is aged, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the [typical] young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away.</p>
<p>"Even though I was endowed with such fortune, such total refinement, the thought occurred to me: 'When an untaught, run-of-the-mill person, himself subject to illness, not beyond illness, sees another who is ill, he is horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted, oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness, not beyond illness. And if I &mdash; who am subject to illness, not beyond illness &mdash; were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is ill, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the healthy person's intoxication with health entirely dropped away.</p>
<p>"Even though I was endowed with such fortune, such total refinement, the thought occurred to me: 'When an untaught, run-of-the-mill person, himself subject to death, not beyond death, sees another who is dead, he is horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted, oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death, not beyond death. And if I &mdash; who am subject to death, not beyond death &mdash; were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is dead, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the living person's intoxication with life entirely dropped away.</p>
<p style='text-align:center'><a id="asterisk">* * *</a></p>
<p>"Monks, <a id="forms3">there are these</a> three forms of intoxication. Which three? Intoxication with youth, intoxication with health, intoxication with life.</p>
<p>"Drunk with the intoxication of youth, an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person engages in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct. Having engaged in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct, he &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell.</p>
<p>"Drunk with the intoxication of health, an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person engages in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct. Having engaged in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct, he &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell.</p>
<p>"Drunk with the intoxication of life, an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person engages in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct. Having engaged in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct, he &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell.</p>
<p>"Drunk with the intoxication of youth, a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life. Drunk with the intoxication of health, a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life. Drunk with the intoxication of life, a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life."</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<a id="rest">'Subject</a> to birth, subject to aging,
	subject to death,
run-of-the-mill people
are repelled by those who suffer
from that to which they are subject.
And if I were to be repelled
by beings subject to these things,
it would not be fitting for me,
	living as they do.'

As I maintained this attitude  &mdash;
knowing the Dhamma
without acquisitions  &mdash;
I overcame all intoxication
with health, youth, &amp; life
	as one who sees
	renunciation as rest.

For me, energy arose,
Unbinding was clearly seen.
There's now no way
I could partake of sensual pleasures.
Having followed the holy life,
	I will not return.
