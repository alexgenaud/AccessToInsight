<div class="chapter">
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>At one time the Blessed One was residing in Jetavana, the monastery of Anathapindika, near Savatthi. At that time the Blessed One, having called all the bhikkhus together, addressed them thus: "Bhikkhus!" The bhikkhus answered in assent: "Lord!" (The bhikkhus then prepared themselves for the following teaching.) The Blessed One then gave the following teaching on Uposatha.</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus. Uposatha is comprised of eight factors which the Ariyan disciple observes, the observation of which brings glorious and radiant fruit and benefit.</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus. What is the Uposatha which, observed by the Ariyan disciples, brings glorious and radiant fruit and benefit?"</p>
<p>1. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, have given up the intentional taking of life.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> The club and sword have been laid down. They have shame (of doing evil) and are compassionate toward all beings.'</p>
<p>"All of you have given up the intentional taking of life, have put down all weapons, are possessed of shame (of doing evil) and are compassionate toward all beings. For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the first factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>2. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, have given up taking what has not been given.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> They take only what is given, are intent on taking only what is given. They are not thieves. Their behavior is spotless.'</p>
<p>"All of you have given up the taking of what has not been given, are ones who do not take what is not given, are intent on taking only what is given, are not thieves. Your behavior is spotless. For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the second factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>3. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, have given up that which is an obstacle to the Brahma-faring.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> Their practice is like that of a Brahma. They are far from sexual intercourse, which is a practice of lay people.'</p>
<p>"All of you have given up that which is an obstacle to the Brahma-faring and behave like a Brahma. Your behavior is far from sexual intercourse. For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the third factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>4. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, have given up the telling of lies.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a> They utter only the truth and are intent on the truth. Their speech is firm and is composed of reason. Their speech does not waver from that which is a mainstay for the world.'</p>
<p>"All of you have given up the telling of lies. You speak only the truth and are intent only on that which is true. Your speech is firm and with reason. Your speech does not waver from that which is a mainstay for the world. For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the fourth factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>5. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, have given up the taking of liquors and intoxicants,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a> of that which intoxicates, causing carelessness. They are far from intoxicants.'</p>
<p>"All of you have given up the taking of liquors and intoxicants. You abstain from drink which causes carelessness. For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the fifth factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>6. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, eat at one time only and do not partake of food in the evening. They abstain from food at the 'wrong time'."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6'>[6]</a></p>
<p>"All of you eat at one time only and do not partake of food in the evening. You abstain from food at the 'wrong time.' For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the sixth factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>7. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, have given up singing and dancing, the playing of musical instruments and the watching of entertainments, which are stumbling blocks to that which is wholesome. Nor do they bedeck themselves with ornaments, flowers or perfume.'</p>
<p>"All of you have given up singing and dancing, the playing of musical instruments and the watching of entertainments, which are stumbling blocks to that which is wholesome. You do not bedeck yourselves with ornaments, flowers or perfume. For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the seventh factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>8. "Bhikkhus. Ariyan disciples in this Religion reflect thus:</p>
<p>"'All arahants, for as long as life lasts, have given up lying on large or high beds. They are content with low beds or bedding made of grass.'</p>
<p>"All of you have given up lying on large or high beds. You are content with low beds or beds made of grass. For all of this day and night, in this manner, you will be known as having followed the arahants, and the Uposatha will have been observed by you. This is the eighth factor of the Uposatha.</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus. The Uposatha is comprised of these eight factors which the Ariyan disciple observes, and it is of great and glorious fruit and benefit."</p>
<p>Thus the Blessed One spoke on the Uposatha. The bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced at his words.</p>
