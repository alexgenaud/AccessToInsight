<h1>Translator's Notes</h1>
<p>The above translation (as well as <a href='../../translators.html#niza'>other translations</a> at ATI by the present translator) deliberately aims to adhere as closely as possible to the grammar and syntax of the P&#257;&#7735;i text, while at the same time trying to present an easily readable English text. In this way, the translation may be especially useful for students of P&#257;&#7735;i who would like to follow the P&#257;&#7735;i original in parallel to the English translation.</p>

		<dd>The circumstances under which the Buddha uttered this stanza are depicted in <a href='../../kn/ud/ud.7.05.niza.html'>Ud 7.5</a>. There, the Buddha states that Bhaddiya, although outwardly a deformed and unsightly dwarf, is in truth inwardly an Arahant. The Buddha then utters this stanza as a metaphorical depiction of Bhaddiya's true nature.</dd>

		<dd><i>Nela&#7749;go</i>: the commentaries interpret this term as having the sense <i>na</i> (<i>atthi</i>) + <i>ela</i> + <i>a&#7749;ga</i>, 'part without fault'. The subcommentary: "<i>Ela&#7747; vuccati doso, ta&#7747; etassa natth&#299;ti nela&#7747;</i>" (Myanmar Spk-&#7789; ii.372); 'ill-will or hatred' is called 'fault' [<i>ela&#7747;</i>]; this does not [<i>na</i>] exist for him, thus '<i>nela&#7747;</i>'." The word is in the singular, but I think it should be understood with a synecdochal sense: the part standing in for the whole, or the singular for the plural, as when one might say: "a person of pure word and pure deed", meaning, of course, 'pure words' and 'pure deeds'. This reading is in fact supported later in the text by Citta's interpretation of the metaphor, because he explicitly glosses the singular <i>nela&#7749;ga&#7747;</i> with the plural <i>s&#299;l&#257;ni</i>, 'virtues'. Bodhi (<i>Connected Discourses of the Buddha</i>, p. 1321) and &#256;nandajoti [<a href='http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Udana/7-Cullavaggo-05.htm' title='Visit www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net' class='offsite' target='offsite' >www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net</a>] both translate "With faultless wheel...", retaining the singular, but identifying the 'part' (<i>a&#7749;ga</i>) specifically with the <i>wheel</i> of the chariot. While this is perfectly reasonable, I have preferred to take <i>a&#7749;ga</i> as referring to <i>every</i> component part of the chariot's constitution. In either case, the image of the chariot's 'faultlessness' fits in very well with the image of its rolling along smoothly and quietly, 'without disturbance' (<i>an&#299;gha</i>): see <a href='#fn-8'>note 8</a> below.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-3' id='fn-3'>3</a>.</dt>
		<dd><i>Ek&#257;ro</i>: the commentaries read this as <i>eka</i> + <i>ara</i>, and interpret <i>ara</i >as 'spoke': hence, 'one-spoked'. Bodhi (<i>CDB</i>, p. 1321) and &#256;nandajoti [<a href='http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Udana/7-Cullavaggo-05.htm' title='Visit www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net' class='offsite' target='offsite' >www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net</a>] both seem to accept this interpretation, and accordingly translate <i>ek&#257;ro ratho</i> as "one-spoked chariot". Here, too, however, I would like to offer an alternative reading. Personally, I find the image of a 'one-spoked chariot' (which is presumably supposed to mean 'a chariot, each of whose wheels has only one spoke'?) rather odd, particularly given that the word <i>ara</i>, 'spoke', appears to be associated with the idea of the <i>radius</i> of a circle, not its <i>diameter</i> (cf. Monier-Williams, <i>Sanskrit-English Dictionary</i>, p. 86.2; Rhys Davids and Stede, <i>Pali-English Dictionary</i>, p. 76.1; also Cone, <i>A Dictionary of P&#257;li</i>, Part I, p. 232.2). The only way that I could extract some sense from such an image would be to suppose that, if the 'wheel' represents the Dhamma, and has eight spokes, representing the Noble Eightfold Path, then, in the case of an Arahant, by whom all eight 'spokes' have been realized in practice, only one 'spoke' remains functional: namely, the constant 'mindfulness' (<i>sati</i>) which the Arahant quite naturally practices. So, one could perhaps say that there is only <i>one</i> <i>kind</i> of 'spoke' (rather than, literally, just 'one spoke') in the 'wheel' of the Arahant's practice: namely, mindfulness. Nevertheless, this is a rather abstract interpretation.

<p>Consequently, I would like to suggest a different interpretation, here, of <i>ara</i>, derived from the same verbal root from which the noun <i>ara</i>, 'spoke', is derived, as is the adjective <i>ara</i>, 'swift, speedy': namely, &#8730;<i>&#7771;</i>, 'to go, to move' (cf. Whitney, <i>Roots, Verb-Forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language</i>, p. 14; Monier-Williams, <i>SED</i>, p. 223.1; B&ouml;htlingk and Roth, <i>Sanskrit W&ouml;rterbuch</i>, Vol. I, p. 403.1). Monier-Williams points out a usage of <i>ara</i> at the end of a compound, where it has the sense 'going', and cites the example of the word <i>samara</i>, which is analysed into <i>sam</i> + <i>ara</i> (from &#8730;<i>&#7771;</i>), 'coming together, meeting, confluence'; hence also 'hostile encounter, conflict, war' (cf. B&ouml;htlingk and Roth, <i>SW</i>, Vol. VII, p. 689.1: <i>sam</i> + <i>ar</i>, (1) '<i>Zusammenlauf</i>, <i>Zusammenfluss</i>'; (2) '<i>feindlicher</i> <i>Zusammenstoss, Kampf</i>'). (It should be pointed out that Rhys Davids and Stede seem to have misconstrued the P&#257;li <i>samara</i>, 'war', as <i>sa</i> + <i>mara</i>, 'with death', i.e., 'that which is accompanied by death'.) Cone (<i>DP</i>, Part I, p. 232.2) cites only <i>muddha-ara</i> as an example <i>ara</i> at the end of a compound; Rhys Davids and Stede define that term as 'head (top) spoke' (<i>PED</i>, p. 538.2).</p>

<p>I propose to read <i>ek&#257;ra</i> as <i>eka</i> 'one, single, alone' + <i>ara</i> 'going', on the model of <i>sam</i> + <i>ara</i>. The sense would then be either: (1) that the 'chariot' (representing the Arahant) goes always alone; or (2) that the 'chariot' goes always in one direction (i.e., towards Nibb&#257;na); or that it travels always upon one path (i.e., the Noble Eightfold Path); or that it travels only in one way (i.e., in accordance with the Dhamma). These various possible senses are not mutually exclusive, of course.</p>

<p>With respect to the first interpretation, <i>ek&#257;ra</i> as 'lone-going', which implies that the Arahant is completely unattached and lives in seclusion, we may consider that in Ud 7.5 Bhaddiya is described, as seen from afar, following closely behind the mass of approaching monks (<i>d&#363;ratova sambahul&#257;na&#7747; bhikkh&#363;na&#7747; pi&#7789;&#7789;hito pi&#7789;&#7789;hito &#257;gacchanta&#7747;</i> (PTS Ud 76)). The Buddha then describes Bhaddiya as "usually, for the monks, of such an appearance as to be disregarded or despised" (<i>yebhuyyena bhikkh&#363;na&#7747; paribh&#363;tar&#363;pa&#7747;</i> (PTS Ud 76)). Again, Malalasekera, <i>Dictionary of P&#257;li Proper Names</i>, s.v. 'Amb&#257;takavana' (Vol. 1, p. 162), informs us that the Elder Laku&#7751;&#7789;aka Bhaddiya "lived there, in solitude, wrapt in meditation", supporting this with a reference to <i>Therag&#257;th&#257;</i> 7.2 (PTS Th 49)).</p>

<p>On the theme of the 'oneness' or 'aloneness' of the Arahant, we might also cite the following stanza from <i>Suttanip&#257;ta</i> 5, &sect;1142 (PTS Sn 220). (Note that the commentary analyses <i>tamanud&#257;sino</i> into <i>tamonudo &#257;sino</i> (PTS Sn-a ii.604).)</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
eko tamanud&#257;sino, jutim&#257; so pabha&#7749;karo.
gotamo bh&#363;ripa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;o, gotamo bh&#363;rimedhaso.

One sitting alone, dispelling darkness:
	he, the brilliant maker of light:
Gotama, extensive in wisdom,
	Gotama, extensive in intelligence.
	
</div>

<p>The <i>C&#363;&#7735;aniddesa</i> also provides a commentary to this same stanza (Myanmar Nidd II, 210-213), wherein, with reference to the word <i>eko</i>, 'one' or 'alone', in the phrase, "<i>eko tamonud&#257;s&#299;no</i>", it says:</p>

<div class='excerpt'><i>ekoti bhagav&#257; pabbajjasa&#7749;kh&#257;tena eko, adutiya&#7789;&#7789;hena eko, ta&#7751;h&#257;ya pah&#257;na&#7789;&#7789;hena eko, ekantav&#299;tar&#257;goti eko, ekantav&#299;tadosoti eko, ekantav&#299;tamohoti eko, ekantanikkilesoti eko, ek&#257;yanamagga&#7747; gatoti eko, eko anuttara&#7747; samm&#257;sambodhi&#7747; abhisambuddhoti eko.</i></div>

<p>'One' (or 'alone'): the Blessed One, by being classified as one who has taken up the ascetic life, is one; by the meaning of being without companions, is one; by the meaning of having renounced craving, is one; absolutely [<i>ekanta</i>] free of passion, is one; absolutely free of ill will, is one; absolutely free of delusion, is one; absolutely without defilements, is one; having gone [<i>gato</i>] by the one-way path (or the one-goal path) [<i>eka-ayana-magga</i>], is one; having fully and perfectly awakened in the one ultimate right and perfect awakening, is one.</p>

<p>Here, in this passage, we find an echo of both of the senses that I have proposed, hypothetically, for <i>ek&#257;ra</i> read as 'one-going': namely, both 'going alone' and 'going one way'. Finally, we might consider also this passage from <i>Dhammapada</i> (Ch. 23, &sect;305, PTS Dhp 43):</p>

		<dd>"<i>Katha&#7747;... attho da&#7789;&#7789;habbo</i>?" Literally, "how should the meaning <i>be seen</i>"; hence, "how should it be regarded, understood", etc. A little farther on, we find "<i>attha&#7747; pekkh&#257;mi</i>", "I <i>behold</i> or <i>look at</i> the meaning". This use of verbs of 'seeing' with <i>attha</i>, 'meaning', as object, is reinforced at the end of the sutta, where we find <i>pa&#150;&#150;a-cakkhu</i>, 'wisdom-eye' as subject, with "<i>gambh&#299;re buddhavacane</i>", "in or through the profound word of the Buddha" as adverbial locative to the verb <i>kamati</i>, 'to proceed or progress (step by step)'. See <a href='#fn-10'>note 10</a> below.</dd>

		<dd><i>Abhikkamati, pa&#7789;ikkamati</i>: literally, 'stepping forward, stepping back'; hence, 'advancing, retreating'; or 'going, returning'. Bodhi translates this passage: "this is a designation for going forward and returning" (<i>CDB</i>, p. 1321). These correlative terms have some interesting uses in the suttas. The following is an example of one type: "<i>B&#257;&#7735;h&#257; me dukkh&#257; vedan&#257; abhikkamanti, no pa&#7789;ikkamanti. abhikkamos&#257;na&#7747; pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;yati, no pa&#7789;ikkamo</i>." (MN 97 <i>Dh&#257;na&ntilde;j&#257;ni Sutta</i> (PTS MN ii.184), at MN ii.193 f.) This particular formula occurs a number of times throughout MN, SN and AN. &Ntilde;&#257;&#7751;amoli and Bodhi translate this as: "My painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding; their increase and not their subsiding is apparent." (<i>Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha</i>, p. 795, &sect;29.) Thanissaro translates: "My severe pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening." (<a href='../../mn/mn.097.than.html'>MN 97</a>, Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) 2008, 'Dhana&ntilde;jani Sutta: To Dhana&ntilde;jani'). Keeping a little more closely to the literal sense of <i>abhi-kamati</i>, 'stepping towards, against' and <i>pa&#7789;i-kamati</i>, 'stepping back, away', we might also translate: "My excessive painful feelings are advancing, not retreating; their advance is evident, not their retreat."</dd>

		<dd>"<i>R&#257;go kho, bhante, n&#299;gho, doso n&#299;gho, moho n&#299;gho</i>." Concerning this term, <i>n&#299;gha</i>, see <a href='#fn-8'>note 8</a> on <i>an&#299;gha</i>, below. There has been some discussion in the literature about whether <i>an&#299;gha</i>, which is evidently a negative (or privative) form, should be taken as <i>a</i> + <i>n&#299;gha</i> or <i>an</i> + <i>&#299;gha</i>, and several suggestions about its possible etymology and meaning, but no decisive evidence seems to have been discerned. In the Suttanta Pi&#7789;aka, <i>an&#299;gha</i> occurs a number of times, but there are very few occurrences of <i>n&#299;gha</i> (or <i>nigha</i>): for example, here in this present sutta; in SN 45.168, and elsewhere, where this same formula is repeated; in Th&#299; 16.1, &sect;493 (PTS Th&#299; 171) we find "<i>sattis&#363;l&#363;pam&#257; k&#257;m&#257;, rogo ga&#7751;&#7693;o agha&#7747; nigha&#7747;</i>", "like sword-stakes are sensual pleasures, a disease, a boil, pain, <i>nigha&#7747;</i>", the commentary leaving the sense of <i>nigha</i> obscure: "<i>mara&#7751;a-samp&#257;panena</i>" (PTS Th&#299;-a 288), "because of arriving at (leading to?) death". Various other commentary references do not really help to clarify the matter, either.</dd>

		<dd>This is a merely provisional rendering of the P&#257;&#7735;i Buddhist term <i>&#257;sav&#257;</i>, which is a very difficult concept translate into concise English because its meaning is intimately connected with the most essential ideas, principles and motives forming the core teaching of the early P&#257;&#7735;i Buddhadhamma.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-8' id='fn-8'>8</a>.</dt>
		<dd><i>An&#299;gho</i>. The commentary to this sutta glosses this term: "<i>an&#299;ghanti niddukkha&#7747;</i>", i.e., "<i>an&#299;gha&#7747;</i>: without pain or suffering". (PTS Spk iii.93.) The commentary to Ud 7.5, where the origin of this stanza is depicted, says: "<i>an&#299;ghanti niddukkha&#7747;, khobhavirahita&#7747; y&#257;na&#7747; viya kilesaparikhobhavirahitanti attho</i>" (PTS Ud-a 370). "'<i>An&#299;gha&#7747;</i>': without pain or suffering; the meaning is (that he is) completely free of (mental) disturbance [<i>khobha</i>] caused by mental defilements, like a vehicle [<i>y&#257;na&#7747;</i>] free of shaking [<i>khobha</i>]." This interpretation of the meaning of <i>an&#299;gha</i> has the advantage of drawing a nice connection between the poetic metaphor and its reference. Just as a faultlessly constructed chariot rolls smoothly and quietly along, without agitation or shaking, so, similarly, the mind of the Arahant, which has been purified of all defilements, remains always undisturbed and untroubled.</dd>

		<dd>"<i>L&#257;bh&#257; te, gahapati, suladdha&#7747; te, gahapati!</i>" This is a somewhat formulaic expression, and could be read, quite conventionally, as Bodhi reads it (taking <i>l&#257;bha</i> and <i>laddha</i> in their common sense of 'gain, profit'): "It is a gain for you, householder, it is well gained by you, householder..." (<i>CDB</i>, p. 1322). (This accords, in part, with Rhys Davids and Stede, <i>PED</i>, p. 583.1: <i>l&#257;bh&#257;</i> as an adverbial dative, and <i>te</i> as 2<sup>nd</sup> person genitive: "for the gain of you".) This is clearly the proper sense, for example, in Vin 1.1.3, &sect;163 (PTS Vin iii.68), where the type of gain in question is <i>pu&ntilde;&ntilde;a</i>, 'spiritual merit'. Certainly, Citta's correct interpretation of the stanza could be viewed as a source of spiritual merit for him.

<p>Even so, in this present context, I have ventured a slightly different reading. <i>L&#257;bha</i> means 'receiving, getting, acquisition, gain' (from the verb <i>labhati</i>, 'to get, receive, obtain, acquire'). <i>Laddha</i> (past participle of <i>labhati</i>) is 'having obtained, taken, received', and thus <i>suladdha</i> is 'well-received, well-gained'. If we took both occurrences of <i>te</i> as instrumental, 'by you', we might arrive at the alternative rendering that I have proposed. More colloquially expressed, the sense would be: "You <i>got</i> it, householder, you <i>got</i> it <i>well</i>, householder!" This would provide a neat sense, given the context of the 'riddle' that K&#257;mabh&#363; has posed, and Citta's fairly thorough solution of it.</p></dd>

		<dd>This is a rendering of the verb <i>kamati</i> (Skt. <i>kramati</i>), which literally means 'to step, to walk (step by step), to go'; thus, among the primary meanings of Skt. <i>krama</i> (lit., 'a step'), we find: "uninterrupted or regular progress, order, series, regular arrangement, succession" (Monier-Williams, <i>SED</i>, p. 319.3). Bodhi translates: "ranges over" (Bodhi, <i>CDB</i>, p. 1322).</dd>
