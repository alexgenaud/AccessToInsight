<div class="chapter">
<p>"Monks, concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, when developed &amp; pursued, is of great fruit, of great benefit. And how is concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing developed &amp; pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit?</p>

<p>&nbsp;"There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>

<p>"{1} Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' {2} Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' {3} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' {4} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming the bodily fabrication.'</p>

<p>"{5} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture.' {6} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure.' {7} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a> He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication.' {8} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication.'</p>

<p>"{9} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind.' {10} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind.' {11} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in steadying the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out steadying the mind. {12} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in releasing the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out releasing the mind.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a></p>

<p>"{13} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy.' {14} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6'>[6]</a> He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion.' {15} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation.' {16} He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.'</p>

<p>"This is how concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is developed &amp; pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit.</p>

<p>"I, too, monks, before my awakening, when I was an unawakened bodhisatta, frequently remained with this abiding. When I frequently remained with this abiding, neither my body was fatigued nor were my eyes, and my mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released from fermentations.</p>

<p>"So if a monk should wish: 'May neither my body be fatigued nor my eyes, and may my mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, be released from fermentations,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May my memories &amp; resolves related to the household life be abandoned,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"If a monk should wish: 'May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"If a monk should wish: 'May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome &amp; what is,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"If a monk should wish: 'May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome &amp; what is not,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"If a monk should wish: 'May I &mdash; in the presence of what is loathsome &amp; what is not &mdash; cutting myself off from both &mdash; remain equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enter &amp; remain in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enter &amp; remain in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish, 'May I, with the fading of rapture, remain equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, sense pleasure with the body, and enter &amp; remain in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, "Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding,"' then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish, 'May I, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; enter &amp; remain in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain,' then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space,' enter &amp; remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' enter &amp; remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' enter &amp; remain in the dimension of nothingness,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, enter &amp; remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enter &amp; remain in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"When concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is thus developed, thus pursued, then if he senses a feeling of pleasure, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of pain, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of pleasure, he senses it disjoined from it. If he senses a feeling of pain, he senses it disjoined from it. If he senses a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he senses it disjoined from it. When sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.' He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, everything that is experienced, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'</p>

<p><a id="lamp"></a>"Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil &amp; wick; and from the termination of the oil &amp; wick &mdash; and from not being provided any other sustenance &mdash; it goes out unnourished; in the same way, when sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.' He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, everything that is sensed, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'"</p>

	<dd>To the fore <i>(parimukham):</i> The Abhidhamma takes an etymological approach to this term, defining it as around <i>(pari-)</i> the mouth <i>(mukham).</i> In the Vinaya, however, it is used in a context (Cv.V.27.4) where it undoubtedly means the front of the chest. There is also the possibility that the term could be used idiomatically as "to the front," which is how I have translated it here.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-2" id="fn-2">2</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The commentaries insist that "body" here means the breath, but this is unlikely in this context, for the next step &mdash; without further explanation &mdash; refers to the breath as "bodily fabrication." If the Buddha were using two different terms to refer to the breath in such close proximity, he would have been careful to signal that he was redefining his terms (as he does below, when explaining that the first four steps in breath meditation correspond to the practice of focusing on the body in and of itself as a frame of reference). The step of breathing in and out sensitive to the entire body relates to the many similes in the suttas depicting jhana as a state of whole-body awareness (see <a href="../../mn/mn.119.than.html">MN 119</a>).</dd>
