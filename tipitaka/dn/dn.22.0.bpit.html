[SUMMARY]={This sutta offers comprehensive practical instructions on the development of mindfulness in meditation. The Buddha describes how the development of continuous mindfulness of the four <i>satipatthana</i> ("foundations of mindfulness" or "frames of reference") &mdash; mindfulness of the body, of feelings, of the mind, and of mind-objects &mdash; can lead ultimately to full Awakening. [The text of this sutta is identical to that of the <a href='../mn/mn.010.than.html'>Satipatthana Sutta</a> (MN 10), except that the Majjhima version omits the exposition of the Four Noble Truths (sections 5a,b,c and d in part D of this version).]}

Thus have I heard: The Bhagava was at one time residing at the market-town called Kammasadhamma in the Kuru Country. There the Bhagava addressed the bhikkhus, saying: &quot;O Bhikkhus,&quot; and they replied to him, &quot;Venerable Sir.&quot; The Bhagava said:</p>

<h2>Perception of the True Nature of the Body</h2>

<h3>1. Section on Breathing</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-374'>374.</a></span>
Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the body?</p>

<p>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following the practice of my Teaching, having gone to the forest, or to the foot of a tree or to an empty, solitary place, sits down cross-legged, keeping his body erect, and sets up mindfulness, orienting it.<!-- fn16 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-16' id='fnt-16' title='Towards the object of .'>[16]</a> 
</p>

<p>Then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out.</p>

<p>Breathing in a long inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation.</p>

<p>Breathing in a short inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation.</p>

<p>He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. [By being fully conscious of the inhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. [By being fully conscious of the exhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out. <!-- fn17 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-17' id='fnt-17' title='No special effort is necessary to calm down the strong inhalation and exhalation. The more one gets mental concentration the more the strong inhalation and exhalation will calm down. When the mental concentration reaches its highest point, inhalation and ...'>[17]</a></p>

<p>Just as, bhikkhus, a skilful turner or a turner's apprentice knows a long pull<!-- fn18 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-18' id='fnt-18' title='On the string turning the .'>[18]</a> when a long pull is made, or knows a short pull when a short pull is made, even so, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu breathing in a long inhalation is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation, or breathing in a short inhalation is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. He trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out.</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his.<!-- fn19 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-19' id='fnt-19' title='I.e., it is his own breathing, and he perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature.'>[19]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena<!-- fn20 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20' id='fnt-20' title='Which is the .'>[20]</a> of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his<!-- fn21 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-21' id='fnt-21' title='His own .'>[21]</a> or which is that of others.</p>

<p>When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes. <!-- fn22 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-22' id='fnt-22' title='The causes of the appearing and dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is inhalation and exhalation are the existence or the non-existence of the body, the nose and the mind.'>[22]</a></p>

<p>And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena.<!-- fn23 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-23' id='fnt-23' title='Which is inhaling and .'>[23]</a> That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights<!-- fn24 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-24' id='fnt-24' title='I.e.,'>[24]</a> progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Breathing]</p>


<h3>2. Section on Body Movement and Posture</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-375'>375.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu when walking, is conscious of walking; or when standing, he is conscious of standing; or when sitting, he is conscious of sitting; or when lying down, he is conscious of lying down; or in whatever movement or posture his body is, he is conscious of it.</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body.<!-- fn25 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-25' id='fnt-25' title='And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless, and repulsive nature.'>[25]</a> Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others. In this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own body or which is that of others.</p>

<p>When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body, with their causes.<!-- fn26 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-26' id='fnt-26' title='The causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment. They and their effect, i.e., the continuous appearance of physical phenomena, are called five Samudaya dhamma. The perception of these ...'>[26]</a></p>

<p>And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena.<!-- fn27 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-27' id='fnt-27' title='"Without soul or atta directing it" -- this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height. Before he reaches this mental state, he occasionally imagines, in spite of his efforts to be mindful, (a) that body and limbs are his,...'>[27]</a></p>

<p>That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights<!-- fn28 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-28' id='fnt-28' title='I.e.,'>[28]</a> progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Body Movement and Posture]</p>


<h3>3. Section on Clear Comprehension</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-376'>376.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu in moving forward and in moving back does so with clear comprehension; in looking straight ahead and sideways, he does so with clear comprehension; in bending and in stretching his limbs, he does so with clear comprehension; in carrying or wearing the great robe, alms-bowl and the other two robes, he does so with clear comprehension; in eating, drinking, chewing and savouring, he does so with clear comprehension; in defecating and urinating, he does so with clear comprehension; in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking, speaking or in keeping silent, he does so with clear comprehension.</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Clear Comprehension]</p>

<h3>4. Section on Consideration of Repulsiveness</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-377'>377.</a></span>
And again. bhikkhus, the bhikkhu examines and reflects closely upon this very body, from the soles of the feet up and from the tips of the hair down, enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities, [thinking thus:] &quot;There are in this body: hair of the head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes,<!-- fn29 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-29' id='fnt-29' title='Including the pleura, the diaphragm and other forms of membrane in the .'>[29]</a> spleen, lungs, large intestine, small intestine, contents of the stomach, faeces, (brain),<!-- fn30 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-30' id='fnt-30' title='The brain is not included in the Pali Text of this Sutta; but is included in the Patisambhida Magga.'>[30]</a> bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, solid fat, tears, liquid fat, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid<!-- fn31 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-31' id='fnt-31' title='I.e., lubricating oil of the .'>[31]</a> and urine.</p>

<p>Just as if, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at each end, and full of various kinds of grain such as hill-paddy, paddy, green gram, cow-pea, sesame and husked rice; and a man with sound eyes, having opened it, should examine and reflect on the contents thus: &quot;This is hill-paddy, this is paddy, this is green gram, this is cow-pea, this is sesame, this is husked rice,&quot; even so, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body, from the soles of the feet up and from the tips of the hair down, enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities, [thinking thus:] &quot;There are in this body: hair of the head,... urine.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Consideration of Repulsiveness]</p>


<h3>5. Section on Consideration of the Primary Elements</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-378'>378.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this body, in whatever position it remains or is placed, as composed of the primary elements:<!-- fn32 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-32' id='fnt-32' title='The primary elements: dhatu, &#039;element&#039;, is a force of Nature which behaves in accordance with the laws of Nature. The four primary elements literally translated above for the sake of brevity as &#039;earth, water, fire, and air elements&#039; ...'>[32]</a> &quot;There are in this body only the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.&quot;</p>

<p>Just as if, bhikkhus, a skilful butcher or a butcher's apprentice, having slaughtered a cow and cut it up into portions should be sitting at the junction of four main roads,<!-- fn33 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-33' id='fnt-33' title='So that only pieces of meat are seen and not the cow as .'>[33]</a> even so the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body in whatever position it remains or is placed, as composed of the primary elements:</p>

<p>&quot;There are in this body only the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Consideration of the Primary Elements]</p>



<h3>6. Section on Nine Kinds of Corpses</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-379'>379.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body, one day dead, or two days dead, or three days dead, swollen, turning black and blue, and festering, abandoned in the charnel-ground, he applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Indeed, this body of mine, too, is of the same nature; it will become like that; it cannot escape such a fate.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-402'>402.</a></span>
And, bhikkhus, what is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Dukkha? It is the Noble Path of Eight Constituents, namely; Right View, Right Thinking, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right View? Insight-knowledge of dukkha, Insight-knowledge of the origin of dukkha, Insight-knowledge of the cessation of dukkha,<!-- fn110 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-110' id='fnt-110' title='I.e., .'>[110]</a> Insight-knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha.<!-- fn111 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-111' id='fnt-111' title='I.e., the Path leading to .'>[111]</a> This, bhikkhus, is called Right View.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right Thinking? Thoughts directed to liberation from sensuality, thoughts free from ill will,<!-- fn112 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-112' id='fnt-112' title='I.e., thoughts of loving-.'>[112]</a> and thoughts free from cruelty.<!-- fn113 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-113' id='fnt-113' title='I.e., thoughts of .'>[113]</a> This, bhikkhus, is called Right Thinking.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right Speech? Abstaining from falsehood, from back-biting, from coarse speech, from vain and unbeneficial talk. This, bhikkhus, is called Right Speech.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right Action? Abstaining from killing, from taking what is not given, from wrongful indulgence in sensual pleasures. This, bhikkhus, is called Right Action.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right Livelihood? Bhikkhus, the ariya disciple following my Teaching completely abstains from a wrong way of livelihood, and makes his living by a right means of livelihood. This, bhikkhus, is called Right Livelihood.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right Effort'? Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to prevent the arising of evil demeritorious states of mind that have not yet arisen. He generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to abandon evil demeritorious states of mind that have arisen. He generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to attain meritorious states of mind that have not yet arisen. He generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to maintain the meritorious states of mind that have arisen, to prevent their lapsing, to increase them, to cause them to grow, to make them develop in full.<!-- fn114 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-114' id='fnt-114' title='In samatha, vipassana .'>[114]</a> This, bhikkhus, is called Right Effort.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right Mindfulness?</p>

<p>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu<!-- fn115 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-115' id='fnt-115' title='I.e., the .'>[115]</a> following my Teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body, with diligence, comprehension and mindfulness,<!-- fn116 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-116' id='fnt-116' title='And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless and repulsive .'>[116]</a> thus keeping away covetousness and distress.<!-- fn117 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-117' id='fnt-117' title='Which will appear if he is not mindful of the five .'>[117]</a></p>

<p>The bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation, with diligence, comprehension and mindfulness,<!-- fn118 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-118' id='fnt-118' title='And perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless .'>[118]</a> thus keeping away covetousness and distress.<!-- fn119 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-119' id='fnt-119' title='Which will appear if he is not mindful of the five .'>[119]</a></p>

<p>The bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind, with diligence, comprehension and mindfulness,<!-- fn120 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-120' id='fnt-120' title='And perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless .'>[120]</a> thus keeping away covetousness and distress.<!-- fn121 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-121' id='fnt-121' title='Which will appear if he is not mindful of the five .'>[121]</a></p>

<p>The bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, with diligence, comprehension and mindfulness,<!-- fn122 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-122' id='fnt-122' title='And perceives their impermanent, insecure, and soulless .'>[122]</a> thus keeping away covetousness and distress.<!-- fn123 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-123' id='fnt-123' title='Which will appear if he is not mindful of the five .'>[123]</a></p>

<p>This, bhikkhus, is called Right Mindfulness.</p>

<p>And, bhikkhus, what is Right Concentration?</p>

<p>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu who follows my Teaching, being detached from sensual pleasures and demetitorious factors, achieves and remains in the first jhana, which has initial application of the mind, sustained application of the, mind, delightful satisfaction and bliss, born of detachment from the hindrances.</p>

<p>Having got rid of vitakka and vicara, the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana, with internal tranquillity, with enhancement of one-pointedness of Concentration, devoid of vitakka and vicara, but with piti and sukha born of Concentration.</p>

<p>Having been detached from piti, that bhikkhu dwells in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and experiences sukha in mind and body. He achieves and remains in the third jhana, that which causes a person who attains it to be praised by the Noble Ones as one who has equanimity and mindfulness, one who abides in sukhas.</p>

<p>By dispelling both pain and pleasure, and by the previous disappearance of sadness and gladness, that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the fourth Jhana, a state of equanimity and absolute purity of mindfulness, without pain or pleasure.</p>

<p>This, bhikkhus, is called Right Concentration.</p>

<p>Bhikkhus, this is called the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Dukkha.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-403'>403.</a></span>
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself.<!-- fn124 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-124' id='fnt-124' title='And perceives that they are just Phenomena without any entity or .'>[124]</a> Occasionally realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature: Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma, with their causes. And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the Four Noble Truths, perceiving their true nature.</p>

Indeed, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for seven years, one of two results is to be certainly expected in him: arahatship<!-- fn125 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-125' id='fnt-125' title='A&ntilde;&ntilde;a, the knowledge of final emancipation, arahatta .'>[125]</a> in this very existence, or if there yet be any trace of Clinging left, the state of an an&#257;g&#257;mi.<!-- fn126 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-126' id='fnt-126' title='The state of Non-return to the world of sense-existence, anagami .'>[126]</a></p>

<p>Let alone seven years, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for six years... for five years... for four years... for three years... for two years... for one year</p>

<p>Let alone one year, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for seven months, one of two results is to be certainly expected in him: arahatship in this very existence, or if there yet be any trace of Clinging left, the state of an an&#257;g&#257;mi.</p>

<p>Let alone seven months, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for six months... for five months... for four months... for three months... for two months... for one month... for half-a-month...</p>

<p>Let alone half-a-month, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for seven days, one of two results is to be certainly expected in him: arahatship in this very existence, or if there yet be any trace of Clinging left, the state of an an&#257;g&#257;mi.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-405'>405.</a></span>
Because of these beneficial results, I have declared at the beginning thus: &quot;Bhikkhus, this is the one and only way for the purification of the minds of beings, for overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the complete destruction of physical pain and mental distress, for attainment of the noble Ariya Magga, and for the realization of Nibb&#257;na. That only way is the practice of the four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus spoke the Bhagava. Delighted, the bhikkhus received the words of the Buddha with respectful appreciation.</p>

		<dd>And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless, and repulsive nature.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-26' id='fn-26'>26</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment. They and their effect, i.e., the continuous appearance of physical phenomena, are called five Samudaya dhamm&#257;. The perception of these five Samudaya dhamm&#257; is called Samudaya dhamm&#257;nupassi. They are perceived in the following way:

<p>When the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the body-postures by means of diligence, mindfulness, concentration, comprehension, he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena (nibbatti lakkha&#7751;&#257;): This perception usually begins, when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; paccaya pariggaha &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. From this perception, the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirth of beings take place in a similar way.</p>

<p>Therefore, while the bhikkhu is perceiving the continuous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to: (1) ignorance of Four Ariya Truths; (2) craving for pleasure of the senses; (3) kamma (deeds, words and thoughts) which has the potency for rebirth as its effect; (4) nutriment which is essential for physical phenomena; (5) mind (citta) which is the motivating force; (6) heat and cold. The causes of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factors.</p>

<p>The bhikkhu then realizes that extinction of ignorance of Four Ariya Truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomena. The actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; Sammasana &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. The sign of change is called viparinama lakkha&#7751;&#257;. In fact, the perception of the appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena, by means of nibbatti and viparin&#257;ma lakkha&#7751;&#257;, becomes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; Udayabbaya &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. However, the perception of only the disappearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger, when he achieves the fifth vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; bha&#7749;ga &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a.</p></dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-27' id='fn-27'>27</a>.</dt>
		<dd>"Without soul or atta directing it" &mdash; this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height. Before he reaches this mental state, he occasionally imagines, in spite of his efforts to be mindful, (a) that body and limbs are his, (b) that his j&#299;va (soul or atta) is directing them, to make postures. Occasionally, he even feels proud of and pleased with &quot;his&quot; body and limbs."

<p>These false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; bha&#7749;ga &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. From that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the body. And he is no longer conscious of the body and the limbs as such. And therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in them.</p>

<p>With this perception of the non-existence of the body and limbs, he fully achieves the eleventh vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a, (sa&#7749;kh&#257;rupekkh&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a.)</p></dd>

<ol>
	<li>Pathav&#299;-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing hardness. (It is sometimestranslated as the element of solidity or of extension);</li>
	<li>&#256;po-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attributes of causing cohesion and of causing fluidity. (It is sometimes translated as the element of cohesion);</li>
	<li>Tejo-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing heat or cold, i.e., thermal energy. (It is sometimes translated as the element of heat);</li>
	<li>V&#257;yo-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing motion or impetus. (It is sometimes translated as the element of motion).</li>
</ol>

<p>The Pathav&#299;-dh&#257;tu is predominant in the first twenty items of the list given in Section (4). The &#256;po-dh&#257;tu is predominant in the last twelve items. The Tejo-dh&#257;tu consists of four kinds of heat in the body and V&#257;yo dh&#257;tu consists of six kinds of V&#257;yo in the body.</p></dd>

He is, in fact, required to be mindful of all forms of passion &mdash; weak, medium, strong. In vipassan&#257;, it is a very important point. Whatever takes place in the six senses, however insignificant, however good or bad it is, he is required to be mindful of it. (Passion=pleasure in or craving for something).</dd>

<dt><a href='#fnt-57' id='fn-57'>57</a>.</dt>
		<dd>'Sa-uttara', and 'anuttara' are relative terms, indicating inferior and superior states of mind. A state of mind that has some other state of mind superior to it, and is therefore inferior, is sa-uttara citta; a state of mind that is superior to some other state of mind is anuttara citta. K&#257;m&#257;vacara citta, the state of mind of the sensuous realms, is inferior to the r&#363;pa and ar&#363;pa jh&#257;na states of mind. The r&#363;pa jh&#257;na state of mind is inferior to the ar&#363;pa jhana state of mind, but is superior to the k&#257;m&#257;vacara state of mind. In vipassan&#257; practice, the ar&#363;pa jh&#257;na state of mind is superior to both the r&#363;pa jh&#257;na and the kamavacara states of mind. Within the stages of the jh&#257;nas themselves, each jh&#257;na is relatively inferior or superior, progressing to the nevasa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;yatana jh&#257;na which is the highest state of mind. An ordinary yogi who has no experience of jh&#257;na cannot concentrate on the mahaggara or anuttara states of mind.

<p>As a matter of fact, anuttara is normally an epithet for Lokuttar&#257; citta or Magga-phala citta. However, in vipassan&#257; practice, the yogi can concentrate only on the five up&#257;d&#257;nakkhandhas, the five Aggregates which form the objects of Clinging. He cannot concentrate on Magga-phala citta. Therefore, jh&#257;nas are given the epithet anuttara. (The Commentary)</p></dd>

According to the Commentary, Sam&#257;hita citta has (1) upac&#257;ra sam&#257;dhi, and (2) appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi, (i.e., jh&#257;na). Upac&#257;ra sam&#257;dhi is sam&#257;dhi that precedes, and is close to appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi, helping the latter to take place. Appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi fixes the mind on the mental object. The mind with upac&#257;ra sam&#257;dhi generally belongs to the sensuous state of existence. The mind with appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi belongs to the r&#363;pa (fine material) and ar&#363;pa (non-material) jh&#257;nas.</dd>

		<dd>The causes of the appearing of the mind are: Ignorance of the four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, the complex of mental and physical aggregates (n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa). The disappearances of these causes result in the dissolution of the mind.</dd>

		<dd>N&#299;vara&#7751;a: means obstacles in the path of one's spiritual progress. They are hindrances to doing good deeds and to the achievement of jh&#257;nas and of the four Magga Insight, There are five Hindrances:

<p>(a) K&#257;macchanda: all forms of ta&#7751;h&#257;; and lobha, craving and desire.</p>

<p>(b) By&#257;p&#257;da: ill will; harbouring evil desires to ill-treat or destroy others, or to bring others into trouble.</p>

<p>(c) Thina-middha sloth and torpor; feeling or indolence, particularly for doing good and meritorious deeds.</p>

<p>(d) Uddhacca-kukkucca: distraction (or agitation) and worry. This has two aspects: flitting about of the mind (series of thought-moments) in all directions, and worrying over past commissions and omissions.</p>

<p>(e) Vicikicch&#257;: doubt or wavering of mind.</p></dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-66' id='fn-66'>66</a>.</dt>
		<dd>And perceive their soulless nature</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-67' id='fn-67'>67</a>.</dt>
		<dd>And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-68' id='fn-68'>68</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The arising of the Hindrances is due to ayoniso manasik&#257;ra, wrong perception of phenomena, resulting from taking any phenomenon as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non-repulsive. In the case of craving and desire, the N&#299;vara&#7751;a is due to taking what is actually repulsive as non-repulsive; in the case of ill will, the N&#299;vara&#7751;a is due to taking something as being offensive. The non-appearance or disappearance of the Hindrances is brought about by yoniso manasik&#257;ra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive.

<p>The discarded k&#257;macchanda will not rise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded by&#257;p&#257;da will not arise again due to An&#257;g&#257;mi Magga. The discarded thina-middha will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded uddhacca-kukkucca will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga and An&#257;g&#257;mi Magga respectively. The discarded vicikicch&#257; will not arise again due to Sot&#257;patti Magga.</p></dd>

		<dd>Up&#257;d&#257;nakkhandhas are the five khandha Aggregates which are the objects of Grasping or Clinging. The five khandhas are:

<p>(a) r&#363;pakkhandh&#257;, the aggregate of physical phenomena, or the body;</p>

<p>(b) vedan&#257;kkhandh&#257;, the aggregate of sensation or feeling;</p>

<p>(c) sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;khandh&#257;, the aggregate of perception;</p>

<p>(d) sa&#7749;kh&#257;rakkhandh&#257;, the aggregate of volitional thought and action or mental formations, (with the exception of Vedana and sanna); and</p>

<p>(e) vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;nakkhandh&#257;, the aggregate of consciousness.</p>

<p>But the magga-phala citta (lokuttara citta) is not an object of Clinging. Therefore, only the vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;nakkhandh&#257; which does not include magga-phala citta can be the object of Clinging (up&#257;d&#257;na).</p></dd>

		<dd>Fetter: sa&#7749;yojana: a fetter that binds one to endless dukkha. There are ten sa&#7749;yojanas: (i) k&#257;mar&#257;ga, craving for sensual pleasure; (ii) pa&#7789;igha, anger, disappointment, fear, grief, ill will; (iii) m&#257;na, pride, conceit; (iv) sakk&#257;ya-di&#7789;&#7789;hi, belief in the illusion that there is Self, Soul; (v) vicikicch&#257;, doubt, wavering, scepticism. (see footnote on the Hindrances in Para 382); (vi) s&#299;labbatapar&#257;m&#257;sa, the misleading belief that there are paths, other than the Ariya Path of Eight Constituents, that can liberate one from dukkha; (vii) bhavar&#257;ga, craving to become a brahm&#257; with mind and body, (r&#363;par&#257;ga) or craving to become a brahm&#257; with only mind and no body (ar&#363;par&#257;ga); (viii) iss&#257;, jealousy, envy; (ix) macchariya, meanness and stinginess; (x) avijj&#257;, ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. This list is according to the Abhidhamma classification.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-76' id='fn-76'>76</a>.</dt>
		<dd>A fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise due to ayoniso-manasik&#257;ra; the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded through yoniso-manasik&#257;ra; due to one of the four Ariya Maggas the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.</dd>

		<dd>The causes for the appearing of the physical sense-bases are ignorance of the four Noble Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment; and the dissolution of those physical sense-bases is due to the disappearance of these causes. The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind base are the same as those for the Mind; (see footnote to Para 381). The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind-object base, which are not already included in the physical sense-bases, are the same as those for Sensation; (see footnote to Para 380).</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-79' id='fn-79'>79</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Bojjha&#7749;g&#257;, pl. of bojjha&#7749;ga: from bodhi + a&#7749;ga. Bodhi=knowledge of the four Ariya Truths, Enlightenment, through vipassana insight, and magga-phala insight, A&#7749;ga factor leading to such knowledge. Bojjha&#7749;ga is generally translated as factor of enlightenment or enlightenment-factor.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-80' id='fn-80'>80</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Factors which enable one to comprehend the four Ariya Truths</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-81' id='fn-81'>81</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Sati-sambojjha&#7749;ga: This is a combination of three words, namely, sati=steadfast mindfulness + sam=well, positively, clearly + bojjha&#7749;ga= one of the seven bojjha&#7749;ga. Sati-sambojjha&#7749;ga is the bojjha&#7749;ga of steadfast mindfulness that enables one to comprehend clearly the four Ariya Truths.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-82' id='fn-82'>82</a>.</dt>
		<dd>This is due to yoniso manasik&#257;ra: yoniso =proper + manasik&#257;ra=attention to the object. (See footnote to para 382). This also applies to the three factors of enlightenment.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-83' id='fn-83'>83</a>.</dt>
		<dd>This is due to Arahatta-magga: the fourth and final stage of Magga Insight, Magga &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a, in which all the kilesas, moral defilements, are eradicated. This also applies to the other factors of enlightenment.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-84' id='fn-84'>84</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Dhammavicaya is a combination of two words, namely, dhamma + vicaya. Dhamma means the five khandhas, or n&#257;mar&#363;pa, mental and physical phenomena. Vicaya means knowledge through proper investigation. Here, investigation means vipassan&#257; bh&#257;van&#257;. So dhammavicaya means knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas by means of vipassan&#257; bh&#257;van&#257;.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-85' id='fn-85'>85</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Viriya-sambojjha&#7749;ga: Viriya means the right effort to be mindful. It is a well-balanced effort which is neither unduly strong nor unduly weak. If the effort is unduly weak, the bhikkhu cannot achieve mental concentration (sam&#257;dhi). If it is unduly strong, be will become so exhausted that sam&#257;dhi, which he has already achieved, can be impaired.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-86' id='fn-86'>86</a>.</dt>
		<dd>P&#299;ti: when one's viriya, effort, becomes well-balanced, after attaining sati, steadfast mindfulness, and dhamma-vicaya, knowledge of the true nature or n&#257;mar&#363;pa, one gets p&#299;ti, joy and satisfaction which may thrill one through and through.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-87' id='fn-87'>87</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Passaddhi- sambojjha&#7749;ga: After one has got p&#299;ti-sambojjha&#7749;ga, one naturally gets passaddhi-sambojjha&#7749;ga. Before this stage, one has to start the meditation process by making a definite effort to be steadfastly mindful. However, when this Passaddhi stage has been once reached, mindfulness takes place without much effort.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-88' id='fn-88'>88</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Sam&#257;dhi-sambojjha&#7749;ga is a logical consequence of p&#299;ti -sambojjha&#7749;ga and pasaddhi-sambojjha&#7749;ga. When the bhikkhu achieves it, he is instantly and closely aware of every object as it appears in his mind.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-89' id='fn-89'>89</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Upekkh&#257;-sambojjha&#7749;ga is a bojjha&#7749;ga that keeps a balance between saddh&#257; (faith) and pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257; (knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas, by means or vipassan&#257; bh&#257;van&#257;. It also keeps a balance between viriya and sam&#257;dhi.</dd>

		<dd>And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-91' id='fn-91'>91</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The arising of the Bojjha&#7749;ga, factors of enlightenment, is due to yoniso-manasik&#257;ra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive. The non-appearance or disappearance of a bojjha&#7749;ga is due to ayoniso-manasik&#257;ra, wrong perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non repulsive.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-92' id='fn-92'>92</a>.</dt>
		<dd>And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-93' id='fn-93'>93</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Dukkha as a Noble Truth is left untranslated. &quot;Suffering&quot; and &quot;ill&quot; are inadequate renderings. Dukkha is inherent in existence. The five Aggregates which are the objects of Clinging therefore embody dukkha. Dukkha has connotations of impermanence, insubstantiality, unsatisfactoriness, emptiness, imperfection, insecurity, besides the obvious ones of suffering, physical pain (as in para 393) and mental affliction.</dd>

Vibhava- ta&#7751;h&#257; is hankering after and becoming attached to the idea that there is no kamma for rebirth, and hence no future existence.</dd>
