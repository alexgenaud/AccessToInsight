                <li><a href="../tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.115.than.html">Marapasa Sutta (SN 35.115) &mdash; Mara's Power</a>. The Buddha explains that once one completely frees oneself from chasing after sense pleasures, one is then finally out of reach of Mara, the embodiment of evil.</li>

                <li><a href="../tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.199.than.html">Kumma Sutta (SN 35.199) &mdash; The Tortoise</a>. If we guard the senses wisely, as a turtle guards against attack by withdrawing into the safety of its shell, we are safely out of Mara's reach.</li>

When shot by the arrow of physical pain, an unwise person makes matters worse by piling mental anguish on top of it, just as if he had been shot by two arrows.
