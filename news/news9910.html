            <small>[27 October 1999]</small>: <b>New talks from Ajaan Lee</b>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="../lib/thai/lee/startsmall.html"><b>Starting Out Small: A Collection of Talks for Beginning Meditators</b></a>, by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo, translated from the Thai by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (1999; 114k/33pp.) This collection of fourteen short talks provides an excellent introduction to Ajaan Lee's approach to breath meditation. Although the talks make for great reading, they make for even better listening. If you meditate with a group of friends, try arranging for one member of the group to read a passage while the others are meditating. In that way you can best recreate the context for which the talks were originally intended.</li>

            <small>[26 October 1999]</small>: <b>Poems on non-clinging, from the Sutta Nipata</b>
            <ul>
                <li>A complete translation of the <a href="../tipitaka/kn/snp/index.html#vagga-4">Atthaka Vagga</a>, the fourth chapter of the <a href="../tipitaka/kn/snp/index.html">Sutta Nipata</a>, is now available. These sixteen poems, on the theme of non-clinging, were originally composed for an audience of wandering, homeless monks. Even so, these poems offer valuable lessons for lay people as well, particularly when the passages referring directly to the homeless life are read as symbolic of a state of mind (see Thanissaro Bhikkhu's <a href="../tipitaka/kn/snp/index.html#vagga-4">Introduction</a> for details).</li>

            <small>[24 October 1999]</small>: <b>Etiquette and duties for monks (and laypeople, too)</b>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="../tipitaka/vin/cv/cv.08x.than.html">Vatta Khandaka (Cv 8) &mdash; Collection of Duties</a>. This chapter from the Vinaya concerns the duties that govern the day-to-day life of the bhikkhus (monks). Many of the duties outlined here are more subtle than the strict rules laid out elsewhere in the Vinaya, and call on the bhikkhus to cultivate a respectful and well-mannered sensitivity to others in the monastic community. Although this text is principally intended for monks, laypeople will find in it many useful hints for the mindful cultivation of good habits and manners, even in the midst of a busy lay life.</li>

                <li><a href="../lib/thai/suwat/fistful.html"><b>A Fistful of Sand</b></a>, by Ajaan Suwat Suvaco, translated from the Thai by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (1999; 120k/40pp.) Ajaan Suwat, an elder Thai forest monk, has been an important presence over the past two decades in bringing the teachings of the Thai forest tradition to the United States. These Dhamma talks and question-and-answer sessions were recorded during a two-week meditation retreat he taught at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts in 1990. This event marked a rare opportunity for an elder Thai <i>ajaan</i> to speak directly to Westerners in their home environment. With a disarming ease and clarity, Ajaan Suwat here illuminates a number of vital points of Dhamma that will help the reader develop the proper attitude towards the practice of meditation.</li>
