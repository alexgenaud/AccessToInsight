Kesi is so moved by the Buddha's explanation that he pledges to follow the Buddha for life.

                <li><a href="../tipitaka/an/an04/an04.113.than.html">Patoda Sutta (AN 4.113) &mdash; The Goad-stick</a>. How much dukkha do you need before you're moved to practice the Dhamma in earnest? What would it take to get you <i>really</i> motivated?
