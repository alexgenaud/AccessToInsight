<h1><a id='preface'>Preface</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>Unlike the anthology of the A.nguttara Nikaaya in this series by the Ven. Nyaanaponika, this selection from the Sa.myutta is by three different hands: <a href="../ireland/wheel107.html">Part I (WH 107-109)</a> by John D. Ireland, <a href="../nanananda/wheel183.html">Part II (WH 183-185)</a> by the Ven. &Ntilde;aa.nananda, and Part III by the undersigned. Since the choice of each translator ranged over the entire Nikaaya, the three parts do not present the whole material in canonical order. Accordingly an index has been provided showing all extracts in that order. A certain lack of terminological consistency was another unavoidable disadvantage, though this is in practice probably not very serious. It should further be noted that the Anthology does not include three important items &mdash; the Buddha's first three sermons &mdash; since these have already appeared in <a href="../nanamoli/wheel017.html">No. 17 of the Wheel series</a>. With one small exception, too, the important Vedana Sa.myutta (SN 36) is not represented, because a separate translation of it has meanwhile been published (<a href="../nyanaponika/wheel303.html">WH 303-304</a>).</p>
<p>The full translation of the Sa.myutta Nikaaya published by the Pali Text Society runs to five volumes, the first two by Mrs C.A.F Rhys Davids (who edited the whole), and the last three by F.L. Woodward. In the preface to Vol. I Mrs Rhys Davids wrote: "It has been more than once suggested that a volume of selections would be of more instant service than would be afforded by the long drawn out appearance of the whole work in its original order... it will be for a later generation to exercise private judgment in compiling eclectic extracts." And indeed anyone familiar with that translation, or with the original will, be likely to agree that a version drastically pruned of much repetitive material is desirable. This selection may be regarded as a contribution towards such a version, which is to be wished for not only in the interests of concision, but because, despite the eminence and the devotion of the original translators, their version has many shortcomings. A certain number of actual mistakes have here been corrected by all three translators, but also many stylistic changes have been deemed necessary. The prose (and the verse!) of the earlier version is often intolerably stilted, sometimes to a point where it is almost unreadable, indeed, scarcely perhaps intelligible, to some present-day readers. Another difference is that whereas the PTS version was intended for a limited, fairly scholarly and largely non-Buddhist public, the present rendering will doubtless be used mainly by practicing Buddhists all over the world, to many of whom English is not their mother tongue but the language of international discourse.</p>
<p>It may safely be claimed that, by presenting their version in good modern English, free from archaic frills, the translators will have succeeded in bringing the message of the Buddha, as found in this Sa.myutta, closer to the reader. It is also safe to say that many will be surprised and delighted at the wealth that it contains, by its vivid similes and occasional humor. Thus in the present volume the reader will find the delightful story of the female deva who tried to tempt a young and handsome bhikkhu, and of how the Buddha dealt with the situation; of how the Buddha persuaded King Pasenadi not to over-eat; we hear how Nanda, the Buddha's cousin, paraded before the Teacher with well-pressed robes and painted eyes; of how the Buddha coped with angry Brahmans and how the Ven. Udaayii taught a Brahman lady to show proper respect for the Sangha; from the Ven. Khemaka we even learn something of what it feels like to be an <i>anaagaamin</i>. There is comfort and hope, too, for those who may feel their human weaknesses debar them from progress, and besides mindfulness we are reminded of the value of faith (not of course blind faith, but a reasoned confidence in the Teacher).</p>
<p>The Sa.myutta Nikaaya deserves to be better known among Western Buddhists than it appears to be, and it is to be hoped that this anthology will help to bring its many treasures to a wider readership.</p>

<h3><a id='passage-1'>1. The Doomed</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-1'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying near Saavatthii, at Jeta Grove, in Anaathapi.n.dika's park. Now a certain deva,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> as the night was passing away, lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with his effulgent beauty, approached the Blessed One and, having approached, stood on one side.</p>
<p>Standing thus on one side, the deva spoke this verse before the Blessed One:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Life but leads to doom. Our time is short.
From Decay there's naught can keep us safe.
Contemplating thus the fear of death,
Let's make merit that will bring us bliss.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Blessed One replied:]</p>

Life but leads to doom. Our time is short.
From Decay there's naught can keep us safe.

Scorn such worldly bait, seek final peace.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a>

<p>...the deva spoke this verse...:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Who has not tamed all vain conceits,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> 
Who lacks in wisdom, uncontrolled,
Heedless, in the woods may dwell alone,
Yet will not escape the realm of death.

<p class="spkr">[The Blessed One replied:]</p>

Who, concentrated, leaves conceits behind,
His heart and mind<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a> set fair, and wholly freed,

Shall indeed escape the realm of death.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>...the deva spoke this verse...:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Hard it is to keep, and hard to bear,
Recluse-life for him who lacks the skill.
Obstacles abound, the fool is lost.
How long can he endure the holy life,
If he cannot hold his heart in check?
Caught now here, now there, he stumbles, falls,
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Blessed One replied:]</p>
<pre>
As the tortoise draws into his shell
Each limb, the monk, withdrawn, with mind applied,
Unattached, and doing harm to none,
Passions wholly stilled, dwells blaming none.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6'>[6]</a>

<h3><a id='passage-4'>4. Samiddhi</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-1'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa Park. Now the Venerable Samiddhi, as dawn approached, arose and went to the Hot Springs<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-7' id='fnt-7'>[7]</a> to bathe. Having bathed, he came out of the Hot Springs and stood, clad in a single garment, drying his limbs. Then a certain she-deva,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8' id='fnt-8'>[8]</a> as the night was passing away, lighting up the entire Hot Springs lake with her effulgent beauty, approached the Venerable Samiddhi and, hovering in the air, addressed him thus in verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Having had no sport, monk seeing alms,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9' id='fnt-9'>[9]</a> 
Having none today, just seeking alms,
Why not get your fill, monk, then seek alms,
Lest your fleeting hour should slip away?<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10' id='fnt-10'>[10]</a> 
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Samiddhi replied:]</p>
<pre>
"Hour" you say, but I know not the hour.
Hidden is my hour, and not revealed:
Therefore, self-restrained, I just seek alms,
Lest my fleeting hour should slip away.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-11' id='fnt-11'>[11]</a> 
</pre>
</div>

<p>Then the she-deva came down to earth and said to Samiddhi: "You are young, bhikkhu, to have left the world, black-haired, with the bloom of youth. In your youthful prime you do not enjoy the pleasures of the senses. Get your fill, bhikkhu, of human pleasures. Don't reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-12' id='fnt-12'>[12]</a></p>

<p>"I, friend, do not reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring. I reject what time will bring to pursue the present moment. Time's pleasures, friend, as the Blessed One has said, are fraught with pain, fraught with tribulation, leading to greater danger. This Dhamma is here-present, out of time, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realized by the wise each for himself."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-13' id='fnt-13'>[13]</a></p>

<p>"In what way, bhikkhu, has the Blessed One said that time's pleasures are fraught with pain, fraught with tribulation and leading to greater danger? In what way is this Dhamma here-present, out of time, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realized by the wise each for himself?"</p>

<p>"I, friend, am fresh, having not long left the world, a newcomer. I am not able to explain in detail this Dhamma and discipline. But the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Self-Enlightened One is staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa Park. Go to the Blessed One and ask him about the matter. Then bear in the mind the explanation he gives to you."</p>

<p>"It is not easy for us, bhikkhu, to approach the Blessed One. He is surrounded by other devas of great power. If you, bhikkhu, will approach the Blessed One and ask him about the matter, then perhaps we can come to hear the teaching."</p>

<p>"Very well, friend," the Venerable Samiddhi replied to her, and he went to the Blessed One, made his obeisance and sat down to one side.</p>

<p>[<i>He then told the whole story in identical words to the Buddha.</i>]</p>

<p>"If, Lord, that deva was telling the truth, she is right here, not far away."</p>

<p>When he had said this, the deva said to the Venerable Samiddhi: "Ask him, bhikkhu, ask him! I've managed to get here!"</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the deva in verse:</p>
<div class="verse">

<h3><a id='passage-6'>6. Taayana</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-1'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Saavatthii...Then Taayana, son of the devas,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-23' id='fnt-23'>[23]</a> formerly a teacher of a [different] sect,...<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-24' id='fnt-24'>[24]</a> spoke thus in verse before the Blessed One:</p>

<div class="verse">
<pre>
Put forth strength and cut the stream at the source,
Brahman,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-25' id='fnt-25'>[25]</a> scatter all desires of the sense.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-26' id='fnt-26'>[26]</a> 
Else the sage can not attain the goal.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-27' id='fnt-27'>[27]</a> 
That which must be done, with vigor do:<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-28' id='fnt-28'>[28]</a> 
Feeble recluseship but stirs up dust.
Better nothing done than evil wrought:
Ill one's done will cause one pain again.
If the deed is good, it's better done:
Good deeds will bring no pain to come.
A blade of grass if wrongly seized,
Will only serve to cut the clumsy hand,
So ascetic life, if wrongly tried,
Merely drags one down to states of woe.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-29' id='fnt-29'>[29]</a> 
Whatever action's slackly carried out,
Practices improperly observed,
Dubious keeping of the holy life:
None of this will bring a great reward.
</pre>
</div>

<p>So said Taayana the devas' son and, so saying, he passed with his right side to the Blessed One in salutation and vanished there and then. And when the night was past the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus.</p>

<p>[<i>He repeated the verses and then said:</i>]</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, learn Taayana's verses, learn them by heart; Taayana's verses are for your good, they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy life."</p>

<h3><a id='passage-7'>7. Jantu</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-1'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Thus have I heard. Once a large number of bhikkhus were living among the Kosalans, on the slopes of the Himalayas, in a forest-lodging. And they were haughty, unsteady, garrulous, of loose speech, unmindful, thoughtless, without concentration, with wandering minds and faculties uncontrolled. Now Jantu, son of the devas, on a fifteenth-day Uposatha,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-30' id='fnt-30'>[30]</a> came into the presence of those bhikkhus and addressed them in verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Happy was the life in former times,
Led by Gotama's disciples then:
Unhankering, they sought their frugal alms,
Unhankering, their lodging and their bed.
The world's impermanence they understood:
Knowing this, they made an end of woe.
Now, making evil-doers of themselves,
Just like village headmen they behave,
Eating, eating, till they drop with sleep,
Coveting the things their neighbor has.
To the Sangha having paid respect,
Certain bhikkhus present here I greet:
Others are like outcasts, masterless,
To the realm of hungry ghosts<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-31' id='fnt-31'>[31]</a> as if consigned.
Those who thus persist in heedlessness
Are they to whom my message is addressed.
But to those who dwell in mindfulness
I accord full honor and respect.

<p>[<i>The Blessed One was at Saavatthii</i>]</p>

<p>At this time King Pasenadi of Kosala was on the upper terrace of the palace with Queen Mallikaa. And the king asked her: "Mallikaa, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-32' id='fnt-32'>[32]</a></p>


<p>"Your Majesty, there is no one dearer to me than myself. And you, sire, is anyone dearer to you than yourself?"</p>


<p>"Nor is there anyone dearer to me, Mallikaa, than myself."</p>

<p>Then the king went down from the palace and visited the Blessed One [<i>and told him the whole story.</i>] And the Blessed One, understanding, thereupon uttered this verse:</p>

<div class="verse">

Though in thought we range throughout the world,
We'll nowhere find a thing more dear than self.
So, since others hold the self so dear,
He who loves himself should injure none.

<h3><a id='passage-9'>9. A Heavy Meal</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-1'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>The King Pasenadi of Kosala dined off a tubful of rice.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-33' id='fnt-33'>[33]</a> Then the King, replete and puffing, went to see the Blessed One, saluted him and sat down to one side. And the Blessed One, observing how he was replete and puffing, at once uttered this verse:</p>

<div class="verse">
<pre>
Those who always dwell in mindfulness,
Observing measure in the food they eat,
Find that their discomfort<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-34' id='fnt-34'>[34]</a> grows the less.

<p>Now just then Prince Sudassana was standing behind the king. And the king said to him:</p>

<p>"Come, my dear Sudassana, learn this verse from the Blessed One and recite it to me when you bring me my dinner, and I will arrange for you to be paid a daily allowance of a hundred pence<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-35' id='fnt-35'>[35]</a> in perpetuity."</p>

<p>"Very well, Your Majesty," said Sudassana [<i>and did as he was told.</i>]</p>

<p>After that the king made it a rule to eat no more than a quarter of a tubful of rice.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-36' id='fnt-36'>[36]</a> Thus it came about that on a later occasion King Pasenadi, his body in good shape, stroked his healthy limbs and fervently exclaimed: "Truly the Blessed One has doubly shown compassion for my welfare, both in this life and in the life to come!"</p>

<h3><a id='passage-10'>10. Dhana&ntilde;jaani</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-1'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying near Raajagaha, in the Bamboo Grove,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-37' id='fnt-37'>[37]</a> at the Squirrels' Feeding-Place. Now at that time the Brahman lady Dhana&ntilde;jaani, wife of a certain Brahman of the Bhaaradvaaja family, was a fervent supporter of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. And this lady, while serving the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman with his dinner, came before him and burst out with this triple inspired utterance: "Praise to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Self-Enlightened One! Praise to the Dhamma! Praise to the Sangha!"</p>

<p>At these words the Brahman said to her "Now then, now then! Every chance she gets this wretched woman has to sing the praises of that shaveling recluse! Now, woman, I'm going to tell that teacher of yours what I think of him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Brahman, I know of nobody in this world with its gods, Maaras and Brahmaas, with its recluses and brahmans, whether they be divine or human, who could thus rebuke the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Self-Enlightened One. But go on, Brahman, go and you will find out."</p>

<p>Then the Brahman, angry and displeased, went to see the Blessed One. After exchanging greetings and compliments with the Blessed One in a friendly and courteous manner, he sat down to one side. So seated, he addressed the Blessed One thus in verse:</p>


<div class="verse">
<pre>
What must we slay to live in happiness?
What must we slay if we would weep no more?
Is there any single thing of which,
You'd approve the killing, Gotama?
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Blessed One replied:]</p>
<pre>
By slaying wrath you'll live in happiness
Slaying wrath, you'll no more need to weep.
Kill the poisoned root of anger, Brahman,
Which with sweetness leads to fevered rage.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-38' id='fnt-38'>[38]</a> 
Killing this the Noble Ones commend:
Slaying this, you'll no more need to weep.
</pre>
</div>

<p>At these words the Brahman said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, good Gotama,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-39' id='fnt-39'>[39]</a> most excellent! It is, good Gotama, as if someone were to set up something that had been knocked down, or to reveal what had been hidden, or to point out the right path to a man who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there &mdash; just so has the good Gotama shown me the truth<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-40' id='fnt-40'>[40]</a> in various ways! I declare<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-41' id='fnt-41'>[41]</a> that I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks, I wish to embrace the homeless life<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-42' id='fnt-42'>[42]</a> under the Lord Gotama, I wish to receive ordination."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-43' id='fnt-43'>[43]</a></p>

<p>So the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman was received into the homeless life under the Blessed One, and received ordination. And not so long after his ordination the Venerable Bhaaradvaaja, remaining alone and secluded, heedful, ardent and resolute, quickly attained that for which young men of good birth rightly go forth from home into the homeless life, coming to realize for himself, in this present life, the unsurpassed goal of the holy life, realizing that "birth is destroyed, the holy life has been accomplished, what was to be done is done! There is no further life in this world."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-44' id='fnt-44'>[44]</a></p>

<p>And that Bhaaradvaaja became an Arahant.</p>

At these words the Blessed One said: "What do you think, brahman? Do you receive visits from friends and colleagues, blood-relations and others?"</p>


<p>"Yes, good Gotama, sometimes such people come."</p>

<p>"What do you think? Do you serve them with solid food, soft food and savories?"</p>

<p>"Yes, good Gotama, sometimes."</p>

<p>"But supposing, brahman, they do not accept what you offer, whose is it?"</p>

<p>"If they do not accept, good Gotama, then it belongs to us."</p>

<p>"So it is here, brahman. The abuse, the scolding, the reviling you hurl at us who do not abuse or scold or revile, we do not accept from you. It all belongs to you, brahman, it all belongs to you!

He who does not answer back in kind,
Celebrates a double victory.

<p>[<i>At Veluvana the wanderer Acela-Kassapa</i> (<i>Naked Kassapa</i>) <i>questioned the Buddha</i>:]</p>

<p>"Well now, good Gotama, is suffering caused by oneself?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, Kassapa," said the Blessed One.</p>

<p>"Well then, good Gotama, is one's suffering caused by another?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, Kassapa."</p>

<p>"Well then, good Gotama, is suffering caused by both oneself and another?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, Kassapa."</p>

<p>"Well then, good Gotama, this suffering which is caused neither by oneself nor by another, is it the result of chance?"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-73' id='fnt-73'>[73]</a></p>

<p>"No indeed, Kassapa."</p>

<p>"Well then, good Gotama, is suffering non-existent?"</p>

<p>"No Kassapa: suffering is not non-existent. Suffering exists."</p>

<p>"Then the good Gotama neither knows nor sees suffering."</p>

<p>"No, Kassapa, it is not that I neither know nor see suffering: I know suffering, I see suffering."</p>

<p>"Well now, good Gotama, when I asked you, 'Is suffering caused by oneself?' you answered 'No indeed' [<i>and so on for all the other questions.</i>] Would the Lord, the Blessed One<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-74' id='fnt-74'>[74]</a> expound suffering to me!

<p>"'He who performs the act also experiences [the result]' &mdash; what you, Kassapa, first called 'suffering caused by oneself' &mdash; this amounts to the Eternalist<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-75' id='fnt-75'>[75]</a> theory. 'One person performs the act, another experiences,' &mdash; which to the person affected seems like "suffering caused by another" &mdash; this amounts to the Annihilationist<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-76' id='fnt-76'>[76]</a> theory.

<p>[<i>The same is repeated for</i> 'without taking care']</p>

<p>"Thus it is friend, that without ardor, without taking care, one is unable to gain enlightenment, unable to gain Nibbaana, unable to gain relief from bondage. And how, friend, is one ardent?

<h3>32. Going Begging: A Stern Admonition (<i>part</i><a id='passage-32'>)</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-3'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>"This, monks, is the meanest<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-148' id='fnt-148'>[148]</a> of callings &mdash; that of one who goes begging! It is a term of abuse in the world to say: 'You scrap-gatherer, wandering about bowl in hand!' This is the life undertaken by young men of good family seeking their own good because it is good, not compelled by rulers, not compelled by robbers, not on account of debts, not through fear, not for a livelihood,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-149' id='fnt-149'>[149]</a> but with the thought: 'Here I am, plunged into birth, decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, thrown into suffering, overcome with suffering! Surely there must be a way of bringing this entire mass of suffering to an end!'</p>

<p>"So, monks, a young man of good family leaves the world, but he is greedy for sense pleasures, with fierce passions, with hate in his heart, corruptly motivated,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-150' id='fnt-150'>[150]</a> lacking in mindfulness, inattentive, unconcentrated, scatter-brained, his faculties uncontrolled. Just as, monks, a funeral-torch lit at both ends and smeared in the middle with dung is no good as fuel either in the village or in the forest &mdash; that is how I would describe that man, who has lost his home and wealth without satisfying the demands of the recluse life. There are, monks, three unskilled ways of thought: thoughts of lust, thoughts of ill-will, thoughts of hurting. And these three unskilled states disappear utterly in him whose heart is well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, or who practices concentration on the signless.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-151' id='fnt-151'>[151]</a></p>

<p>"Indeed, monks, this concentration on the signless is greatly to be commended; the concentration on the signless, if developed and frequently practiced, is of great fruit, of great profit.</p>

<p>"There are, monks, these two views: the existence view and the non-existence view. And the well-taught Ariyan disciple deliberates: 'Is there anything in the world that I can cling to without being at fault?' And he realizes: 'There is nothing in the world that I can cling to without being at fault. Suppose I were to grasp and cling to the body,... to feelings,... perceptions,... the mental formations,... consciousness. Conditioned by my clinging, becoming would arise; conditioned by becoming, birth; conditioned by birth; decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. In that way the whole mass of suffering would arise.'"</p>

<p>[<i>The Ven. Tissa tells the other monks:</i>] "As you see, friends, my body has become as if drugged, I have lost my bearings, the teachings are not clear to me,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-152' id='fnt-152'>[152]</a> my heart is beset with sloth and torpor,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-153' id='fnt-153'>[153]</a> I take no pleasure in the holy life and I have doubts about the teachings."</p>

<p>[<i>The other monks advise Tissa to see the Buddha, who, after catechizing him, gives this simile:</i>] "Suppose, Tissa, there are two men, one of whom does not know his way,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-154' id='fnt-154'>[154]</a> and the other does. And the man who does not know his way asks the other to direct him. He replies: 'Yes, friend, this is the way. Go on for a while and you will see that the road forks. Don't go to the left but take the right-handed path. Go on for a while and you will see a dense jungle. Keep going, and you will see a great sunken swamp. Keep going and you will see a steep precipice. Go a bit further and you will see a delightful stretch of level ground.'</p>

<p>"I have made this parable, Tissa, to help you to understand. This is the explanation. 'The man who does not know his way' denotes the worldling.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-155' id='fnt-155'>[155]</a> 'The man who knows the way' is the Tathaagata, the Arahant, the Fully Self-enlightened One. 'The road-fork' is the state of wavering. 'The left-hand path' is the false eightfold path, that is: wrong view... wrong concentration. 'The right-hand path' is the Noble Eightfold Path, that is: Right View... Right Concentration. 'The dense jungle' means ignorance, 'the great sunken swamp' denotes sense-desires,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-156' id='fnt-156'>[156]</a> 'the steep precipice' denotes anger and despair, 'the delightful stretch of level ground,' Tissa, denotes Nibbaana. Cheer up, Tissa, cheer up! I am here to advise you, help you and teach you!"</p>

<p>[<i>The other monks hear that the Ven. Khemaka has said:</i>] "In these five groups of clinging I perceive no self, nor any thing pertaining to a self." [<i>They therefore wrongly conclude that he is an Arahant. Finally, though sick, he comes in person to explain. They ask:</i>] "As for this 'I am' you mention, friend Khemaka, what is it? Do you say this 'I am' is the body or not the body,... feelings,... perceptions,... mental formations,... consciousness or not consciousness?"</p>

<p>"No, friends, I do not say this 'I am' is the body,... consciousness, nor that it is other than the body,... consciousness. Yet with regard to the five groups of clinging,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-165' id='fnt-165'>[165]</a> 'I am' comes to me,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-166' id='fnt-166'>[166]</a> but I do not consider it (by way of wrong views) as 'This I am.'

<p>"In the same way, friends, I do not say this 'I am' is the body,... consciousness, nor that it is other than the body,... consciousness. Yet with regard to the five groups of clinging, 'I am' comes to me, but I do not consider it as 'This I am.' Though, friends, an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-169' id='fnt-169'>[169]</a> there still remains in him a subtle remnant<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-170' id='fnt-170'>[170]</a> from among the five groups of clinging, a subtle remnant of the 'I'-conceit, of the 'I'-desire, an unextirpated lurking tendency<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-171' id='fnt-171'>[171]</a> to think: 'I am.' Later on he dwells contemplating the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-172' id='fnt-172'>[172]</a> and he sees: 'This is the body, this is its arising, this is its passing away. These are feelings,... perceptions,... mental formations,... this is consciousness, this is its arising, this is its passing away.'</p>

<p>"So, as he dwells thus in contemplation of the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging, this subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging, this subtle remnant of the 'I'-conceit, of the 'I'-desire, this unextirpated lurking tendency to think: 'I am' is brought to an end.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-173' id='fnt-173'>[173]</a></p>

<p>"Friends, it is like a cloth, soiled and stained, whose owners give it to the washerman. He rubs it smooth with salt-earth, lye or cow-dung then rinses it in clean water. Now though the cloth has been cleaned and thoroughly purified, there still hangs about it, unremoved, the subtle smell of salt-earth, lye or cow-dung. The washerman returns it to the owners, who put it away carefully in a sweet-smelling box. Then the smell of salt-earth, lye or cow-dung that still clung to it disappears completely.</p>

<p>"In just the same way, friends, though an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters... [<i>as above</i>]... this unextirpated lurking tendency to think: 'I am' is brought to an end."</p>

<p>Now when this teaching was thus expounded, the hearts of some sixty elders<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-174' id='fnt-174'>[174]</a> were completely freed from the cankers as too was that of Venerable Khemaka.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-175' id='fnt-175'>[175]</a></p>

<p>[<i>At Saavatthii a certain monk said to the Ven. Saariputta:</i>]</p>

<p>"Friend, Saariputta, my companion has renounced the training and reverted to the lower life."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-185' id='fnt-185'>[185]</a></p>

<p>"This is what happens, friend, with one whose sense-doors are unguarded, who is immoderate in eating and not given to wakefulness [<i>like that monk</i>]. As long as he lives it will be impossible for him to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purity. But if a monk guards his sense-doors, is moderate in eating and given to watchfulness, then it will be possible for him, as long as he lives, to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purity.</p>

<p>"And how, friend, does one guard the sense-doors? In this a monk seeing an object with the eye, does not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details. Because anyone dwelling with the eye-faculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection, evil and unwholesome states of mind, therefore he practices to control the eye-faculty, guards it and gains control over it. So one guards the sense-doors.</p>

<p>[<i>Similarly with ear, nose, tongue, body (touch), mind</i>]</p>

<p>"And how, friend, is one moderate in eating? In this a monk takes his food properly considering,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-186' id='fnt-186'>[186]</a> not for sport, for intoxication, for adornment or beautification, but purely for the maintenance and nourishment of this body, for keeping it unharmed, as an aid to the practice of the holy life, thinking: 'I shall put an end to the old feeling,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-187' id='fnt-187'>[187]</a> and not produce any new feeling.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-188' id='fnt-188'>[188]</a> Thus I shall keep going, incur no fault, and live at ease.' That, friend, is how one is moderate in eating.</p>

<p>"And how, friend, is one given to watchfulness? In this a monk walks up and down by day and then sits,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-189' id='fnt-189'>[189]</a> thus cleansing his mind from obstructive states.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-190' id='fnt-190'>[190]</a> [<i>Similarly for the first watch<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-191' id='fnt-191'>[191]</a> of the night.</i>] In the middle watch of the night, lying on his right side, he adopts the lion posture,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-192' id='fnt-192'>[192]</a> resting one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware, with his thoughts fixed on rising. In the last watch of the night he rises, walks up and down, and then sits, thus cleansing his mind from obstructive states. That, friend, is how one is given to watchfulness.</p>

<p>"Therefore, this is how you should train yourselves: 'We will guard the doors of our senses, be moderate in eating and given to watchfulness.'</p>

<p>"This, friend, is the way for you to train yourself."</p>

<h3><a id='passage-42'>42. Bhaaradvaaja Instructs a King</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-4'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>[<i>King Udena of Kosambi consults the Ven. Pi.n.dola-Bhaaradvaaja</i>:] "How can it come about, Bhaaradvaaja, depending on what is it that these young monks, youthful, black-haired, with the bloom of youth, in the prime of life, never having enjoyed the pleasure of the senses, can practice the holy life fully and perfectly to the end of their days?"</p>

<p>"It has been said, sire, by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Fully Self-enlightened One: 'Come, monks, whatever woman is a mother, think of her just as a mother; whatever woman is a sister, think of her just as a sister; whatever woman is a daughter, think of her just as a daughter.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-193' id='fnt-193'>[193]</a> That is how these young monks... can practice the holy life... to the end of their days.'"</p>

<p>"But, Bhaaradvaaja, the heart is fickle. It may well be that at times thoughts of desire arise towards those they think of just as mothers, just as sisters, just as daughters. Is there any other cause, any other reason whereby these young monks, youthful and black-haired... can practice the holy life to the end of their days?"</p>

<p>"It has been said, sire, by the Blessed One...: 'Come, monks, contemplate this body, upwards from the soles of the feet, downwards from the top of the head, bounded by the skin, full of manifold impurities. There are in this body: hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, bowels, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, tallow, saliva, synovic fluid, urine.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-194' id='fnt-194'>[194]</a> That is how these young monks... can practice the holy life... to the end of their days.'"</p>

<p>"Well, Bhaaradvaaja, for those monks who train the body, morals, mind and insight, that is easy, but for those who do not, it is difficult. Sometimes when a man thinks, 'I will regard this as repulsive,' he comes to think of it as attractive. Is there any other cause, any other reason whereby those young monks... can practice the holy life... to the end of their days?"</p>

<p>"It has been said, sire, by the Exalted On...: 'Come, monks, guard the doors of your sense-faculties. Seeing an object with the eye, do not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details. Because anyone dwelling with the eye-faculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection, evil and unwholesome states of mind, therefore practice to control the eye-faculty, guard it and gain control over it. [<i>Similarly with ear, nose, tongue, body (touch), mind.</i>] That is how these young monks... can practice the holy life... to the end of their days.'"</p>

<p>"Wonderful, good Bhaaradvaaja, it is marvelous how well spoken are the words of the Blessed One... I myself, good Bhaaradvaaja, whenever I enter the inner parts of my palace<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-195' id='fnt-195'>[195]</a> with body, speech and mind unguarded, with mindfulness unestablished, with sense-faculties uncontrolled, am at such times overcome with lustful thoughts. But when I do so with body, speech and mind guarded, with mindfulness established, with faculties controlled, then lustful thoughts do not overcome me."</p>

First in virtue were the men of old,
Brahmans who preserved the ancient ways,
In whom well guarded were the doors of the sense.
They were never overcome by wrath.
Meditating on the Law<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-196' id='fnt-196'>[196]</a> their joy,
Brahmans who preserved the ancient ways.
These backsliders who but chant by rote,
Drunk with pride of birth they stagger on.
Full of violent rage, aggression prone,
They lose respect from weak and strong alike:
Their unguarded senses bring them loss,
Like a treasure hoard found in a dream.
Fasting, sleeping on the ground, and such,
Dawn ablutions, chanting Vedic texts,
Garb of skins, matted hair and filth,
Magic spells and rites and penances,
Trickery, deception, blows as well,
Ritual washing, rinsing of the mouth,
These are caste-marks<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-197' id='fnt-197'>[197]</a> of the Brahman-folk,
Done and practiced for some trifling gain.
But a heart that's firm and concentrated,
Purified, of all defilements freed,
Kind and gentle to all living things-
That's the path that gains the highest goal.

<p>[<i>Lohicca goes angrily to see the Ven. Kaccaayana, who confirms what he has said. Then Lohicca asks</i>:] "You said 'with sense-doors unguarded,' Venerable Kaccaayana. In what way is one 'with sense-doors unguarded'?"</p>

<p>"In this case, Brahman, someone, seeing objects with the eye, is attracted to things that are pleasing, and repelled by things that are unpleasing. He dwells without mindfulness and his mind is restricted. He does not experience the emancipation of the heart through wisdom. And so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder. Hearing a sound... smelling a scent... tasting a flavor... touching an object... cognizing a mind-object... he is attracted by things that are pleasing, and repelled by things that are unpleasing... And so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder. That is how one is 'with sense-doors unguarded.' Now in what way is one 'with sense-doors guarded?'</p>

<p>"In this case, Brahman, a monk, seeing objects with the eye, is not attracted to things that are pleasing and not repelled by things that are unpleasing.

<p>"Monks, when a monk knows as they really are both the arising and the destruction of states productive of suffering, then indeed the sense-pleasures are truly seen by him. When he sees the sense-pleasures, the desire and love for sense-pleasures, the infatuation and feverish longing for sense-pleasures that is inherent in them, all this does not obsess him.

<p>A certain monk visited another monk and said: "Tell me, friend, how does a monk's vision become fully purified?"</p>

<p>"Friend, when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the six spheres of contact,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-230' id='fnt-230'>[230]</a> to that extent his vision becomes fully purified."</p>

<p>"Friend, when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the four great elements,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-232' id='fnt-232'>[232]</a> to that extent his vision becomes fully purified."</p>

<p>But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer, so he went to another monk...</p>

<p>"Friend, when a monk fully comprehends as it really is that whatever is of a nature to arise is bound to pass away,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-233' id='fnt-233'>[233]</a> to that extent his vision becomes fully purified."</p>

<p>But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer, and he went to the Blessed One...</p>

<p>"Suppose, monk, a man had never seen a 'what's it' tree. So he went to someone who had seen one,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-234' id='fnt-234'>[234]</a> and said: 'Tell me, good sir, what does a "what's it" tree look like?' The other man replied: 'Well now, a "what's it" tree is sort of blackish, like a burnt stump.' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer, so he went to another man... 'Well now, a "what's it" tree is sort of reddish, like a lump of meat.' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer, so he went to another man... 'Well now, a "what's it" tree is stripped of its bark, with burst pods, rather like an acacia.' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer, so he went to another man... 'Well now, a "what's it" tree has very thick leaves. It gives close shade like a banyan.' So for a while he sees the 'what's it' tree as that man sees it.</p>

<p>"In the same way, monk, according to the way the vision of these wise monks<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-235' id='fnt-235'>[235]</a> has become purified, so they explain it, each according to his disposition.</p>

<p>"It is, monk, just like some king's border-city, with strong walls and arches, and with six gates. And there is a wise, skilled and experienced gatekeeper who keeps out the unknown and admits the known. From the east there come a swift pair of messengers, and they say to the gatekeeper: 'Where is the lord of this city?' &mdash; 'He is over there, sirs, at the cross-roads in the center.' Then the two messengers take a truthful report to the lord of the city, and return the way they came. [<i>Likewise from the west, south, north.</i>]</p>

<p>"I have given you a parable, monk, and so that you can understand it, this is the explanation: 'The city' is a name for the body, composed of the four great elements, born of mother and father, an accumulation of rice and gruel, impermanent, subject to abrasion, dissolution and disintegration. 'The six gates' denote the six internal sense-spheres.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-236' id='fnt-236'>[236]</a> 'The gatekeeper' denotes mindfulness. 'The two swift messengers' denote calm and insight.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-237' id='fnt-237'>[237]</a> 'The lord of the city' denotes consciousness.

<p>"Suppose, monks, there is some ripe corn, and a lazy guardian. And an ox, fond of corn, gets into the field and eats his fill with ravenous delight.

<p>"But suppose, monks, there is some ripe corn, and a vigilant guardian. And an ox, fond of corn, gets into the field. The guardian seizes him firmly by the muzzle. Holding him by the muzzle, he gets a firm grip on his forehead and holds him fast. He then gives him a sound thrashing with a stick, and then lets him go [<i>a second and a third time he does this.</i>] So it comes about monks, that that ox, fond of corn, though he wanders about in the village or the forest, whether he stands still or lies down, will not go into that field again because he remember the beating he got there before. In the same way, monks, when a monk's mind is strongly stirred by the six sense-spheres, nevertheless he stands firm inwardly, becomes calm, one-pointed and concentrated."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-240' id='fnt-240'>[240]</a></p>

<h3>52. The Six Animals (<i>part</i><a id='passage-52'>)</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-4'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>"Suppose, monks, a man catches six animals of different domains and different resorts of living &mdash; a snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal and a monkey, tethering each with a stout rope. Having tethered them with a stout rope, he fastens the ropes together in the middle, he lets them go. Now, monks, these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around struggle, each trying to get to his natural domain. The snake would struggle, thinking 'I'll get to the ant-hill'; the crocodile: 'I'll get into the water'; the bird: 'I'll fly up in the air'' the dog: 'I'll make for the village'; the jackal: 'I'll make for the charnel-ground'; the monkey: 'I'll head for the forest.'</p>

<p>"Now, monks, when those six hungry animals grew weary, they would yield to the one that was the strongest, go his way and be under his power. In the same way, monks, whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body, the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects, while unattractive objects are repellent to him... The mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought, while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to him. This, monks, is lack of restraint. Ant what, monks, is restraint? In this, a monk, seeing objects with the eye, is not drawn to attractive objects, is not repelled by unattractive objects. He remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body, his mind being unrestricted.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-241' id='fnt-241'>[241]</a> He knows in truth that liberation of the heart, that liberation by wisdom,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-242' id='fnt-242'>[242]</a> through which those evil, unskilled states that have arisen pass away without remainder...</p>

<p>"Suppose a man catches six animals (<i>as before</i>), and he fastens the rope together to a stout post or pillar... Then, when those six animals grow weary, they would have to stand, crouch or lie down by the stout post or pillar. In the same way, monks, when a monk practices and develops mindfulness as to the body, the eye does not struggle to draw him towards attractive visual objects, nor are unattractive visual objects repellent to him... the mind does not struggle to draw him towards attractive objects of thought, nor are unattractive objects of thought repellent to him. This, monks, is restraint.</p>

<p>"'Tethered to a stout post or pillar,' monks, denotes mindfulness as to body. Therefore, monks, this is how you must train yourselves: 'We shall practice mindfulness as to body, develop it, make it our vehicle, our dwelling-place our resort, we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly.' This, monks, is how you must train yourselves."</p>

<h3><a id='passage-62'>62. Obligation (Paa.timokkha)</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-5'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>[<i>A certain monk said to the Buddha</i>:] "It would be well for me, Lord, if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone, in seclusion, unwearied, ardent and resolute."</p>

<p>"Well then, monk, you should purify the rudiments of skill. And what are the rudiments of skill?</p>

<p>"In this, monk, you must dwell restrained according to the restraint of the Obligations,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-289' id='fnt-289'>[289]</a> having perfected the scope of your practice,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-290' id='fnt-290'>[290]</a> aware of danger in the slightest faults, undertaking the precepts and training yourself in them.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-291' id='fnt-291'>[291]</a></p>

<p>"Having done this, then, monk, with morality<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-292' id='fnt-292'>[292]</a> as your support, established in morality, you must practice the four foundations of mindfulness. Which four?</p>

<p>"In this, monk, you must dwell in contemplation of body... feelings... mind... mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware, mindful, having got rid of worldly longing and depression.</p>

<p>"Then, monk, when, with morality as your support, established in morality, you have cultivated the four foundations of mindfulness, then you will obtain by night and by day that hoped-for increase in skilled states, which will not decline."</p>

<p>[<i>Delighted, the monk practiced as instructed and, in due course, became an Arahant.</i>]</p>

<h3><a id='passage-63'>63. The Brahman U.n.naabha</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#vagga-5'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">

<p>[<i>At Saavatthii the Brahman U.n.naabha said to the Buddha</i>:] "There are these five sense faculties, good Gotama, of different spheres, different action, and they do not share in each other's sphere of action. Which five? The sense of sight, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-293' id='fnt-293'>[293]</a> As these five faculties are of different scope and range, and do not share in each other's sphere of action, what is their resort,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-294' id='fnt-294'>[294]</a> and who profits from their combined activity?"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-295' id='fnt-295'>[295]</a></p>

<p>"There are, Brahman, these five sense-faculties... which do not share in each other's sphere of action. Mind is their resort, and it is mind that profits from their combined activity."</p>

<p>"But, good Gotama, what is mind's resort?"</p>

<p>"Mind's resort, Brahman, is mindfulness."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-296' id='fnt-296'>[296]</a></p>

<p>"Then, good Gotama, what is the resort of mindfulness?"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-297' id='fnt-297'>[297]</a></p>

<p>"The resort of mindfulness, Brahman, is liberation."</p>

<p>"Then, good Gotama, what is the resort of liberation?"</p>

<p>"The resort of liberation is Nibbaana."</p>

<p>"Then, good Gotama, what is the resort of Nibbaana?"</p>

<p>"That question goes too far Brahman. No answer can encompass it. The aim of the holy life, Brahman, is immersion<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-298' id='fnt-298'>[298]</a> in Nibbaana, it has Nibbaana for its final end, Nibbaana for its conclusion."</p>

<p>The Brahman U.n.naabha was delighted with the words of the Blessed One and rejoiced in them. He rose, saluted the Blessed One and departed. Not long after his departure the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>

<p>"Monks, imagine a house or a pavilion with a peaked roof, with a window to the east. When the sun rises and its rays strike through the window, what do they rest on?"</p>

<p>"On the western wall, Lord."</p>

<p>"Just so, monks, the faith of the Brahman U.n.naabha is settled on the Tathaagata, rooted in him, established in him. It is strong, and cannot be uprooted by any recluse or Brahman, deva or Mara, Brahma or anyone else in the world.</p>

<p>"Monks, if the Brahman U.n.naabha were to die now,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-299' id='fnt-299'>[299]</a> there is no fetter to bind the Brahman U.n.naabha and cause him to return to this world."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-300' id='fnt-300'>[300]</a></p>

<div class="excerpt">

<p>[<i>At Kapilavasthu</i>] Now at that time Sarakaani the Sakyan, who had died, was proclaimed by the Blessed One to be a Stream-Winner, not subject to rebirth in states of woe, assured of enlightenment. At this, a number of the Sakyans, whenever they met each other or came together in company, were indignant and angry, and said scornfully: "A fine thing, a marvelous thing! Nowadays anyone can become a Stream-Winner, if the Blessed One has proclaimed Sarakaani who died to be Stream-Winner... assured of enlightenment! Why, Sarakaani failed in his training and took to drink!"</p>

<p>[<i>Mahaanaama the Sakyan reported this to the Buddha who said</i>:] "Mahaanaama, a lay-follower who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha &mdash; how could he go to states of woe? [<i>And this can be truly said of Sarakaani the Sakyan.</i>] How could he go to states of woe?</p>

<p>"Mahaanaama, take the case of a man endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha, declaring 'He is the Blessed One...'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-304' id='fnt-304'>[304]</a> the Dhamma... the Sangha... He is joyous and swift in wisdom, one who has gained release.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-305' id='fnt-305'>[305]</a> By the destruction of the cankers he has by his own realization gained the cankerless heart's release, the release through wisdom, in this very life, and abides in it. The man is entirely released from the hell-state, from rebirth as an animal,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-306' id='fnt-306'>[306]</a> he is free from the realm of hungry ghosts, fully freed from the downfall, the evil way, from states of woe.</p>

<p>"Take the case of another man. He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha... the Dhamma... the Sangha... he is joyous and swift in wisdom but has not gained release. Having destroyed the five lower fetters,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-307' id='fnt-307'>[307]</a> he is reborn spontaneously<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-308' id='fnt-308'>[308]</a> where he will attain Nibbaana without returning from that world. That man is entirely released from... states of woe.</p>

<p>"Take the case of another man. He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. But he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release. Yet by destroying three fetters<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-309' id='fnt-309'>[309]</a> and weakening lust, hatred and delusion, he is a Once-returner, who will return once more to this world and put an end to suffering. That man is entirely freed from... states of woe.</p>

<p>"Take the case of another man. He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. But he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release. Yet by destroying three fetters he is a Stream-Winner, not subject to rebirth in states of woe, assured of enlightenment. That man is entirely freed... from states of woe.</p>

<p>"Take the case of another man. He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release. But perhaps he has these things: the faculty of faith, of energy, of mindfulness, of concentration, of wisdom. And the things proclaimed by the Tathaagata are moderately approved by him with insight. That man does not go to the realm of hungry ghosts, to the downfall, to the evil way, to states of woe.</p>

<p>"Take the case of another man. He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release.

Yet if he has merely faith, merely affection for the Tathaagata, that man, too, does not go to... states of woe.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-310' id='fnt-310'>[310]</a></p>

<p>"Why, Mahaanaama, if these great sal trees could distinguish what is well spoken from what is ill spoken, I would proclaim these great sal trees to be Stream-Winners... bound for enlightenment, how much more so then Sarakaani the Sakyan!

<dl>
<dt><a href="#fnt-1" id="fn-1">1</a>.</dt>
	<dd>These words are repeated from the beginning of the whole work (SN 1.1), translated in <a href="../ireland/wheel107.html">Vol. I</a> and <a href="../nanananda/wheel183.html">Vol. II</a> with slight differences. I render <i>Bhagavaa</i> literally as "the Blessed One" (Vol. I: "the Lord," Vol. II with KS "the Exalted One"). For the meaning of <i>deva</i> (or <i>devataa</i>) see <a href="../ireland/wheel107.html#fn-1">Vol. I, n.1</a>. In general, information given in the notes to Vols. I and II will not be repeated here.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-2" id="fn-2">2</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The Buddha here makes a vital distinction which is valid to this day as marking the difference between the aims of "popular Buddhism" and the serious treading of the Path. "Merit" (<i>pu&ntilde;&ntilde;a</i>) can lead to a happier rebirth, perhaps in one of the <i>deva</i>-worlds, but this too will come to an end. The proper course is to tread the Noble Eightfold Path and gain the "final peace" of Nibbaana. Note, however, the remarks of the Ven. Khantipalo in <a href="../khantipalo/wheel130.html"><i>The Buddhist Monk's Discipline</i></a> (WH 130/131, p.7): "<i>Pu&ntilde;&ntilde;a</i> is the benefit of increasing purity of mind derived from skillful actions such as generosity, virtue, helpfulness, etc. 'Merit' is an inadequate rendering."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-3" id="fn-3">3</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Maanakaama:</i> "conceit and lust."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-4" id="fn-4">4</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Citta:</i> "mind," but often like the metaphorical use of "heart" in English.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-5" id="fn-5">5</a>.</dt>
	<dd>He will pass "beyond death" to Nibbaana.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-6" id="fn-6">6</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Cf. <i>Bhagavadgiitaa</i> ii, 58: "He who withdraws his senses on all sides from sense-objects as the tortoise draws in his limbs, is firmly established in wisdom." The same image occurs in SN 35.199 (not included in this Anthology).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-7" id="fn-7">7</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This is the meaning of Tapodaa. Cf. place-names such as Teplaa, Teplice in Czecho-Slovakia, all associated with hot springs.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8" id="fn-8">8</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Strictly speaking, "she-deva" is ungrammatical, since deva (<a href="#fn-1">n.1</a>) is masculine (the fem. <i>devii</i> usually means "queen." In all of these little stories the Pali text has the abstract noun <i>devataa</i> which, like our "deity," covers both sexes. It is clear from the context as well as the pronouns used later in some (but not all) manuscripts that this one is female. In its anglicized form, "deva" can perhaps legitimately be taken to denote either sex.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-9" id="fn-9">9</a>.</dt>
	<dd>In Pali there is an untranslatable play here on the two meanings of <i>bhutvaa,</i> "having eaten," and "having enjoyed oneself." Such puns and similar ambiguities are not infrequent in the texts, and are often difficult to bring out in translation.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-10" id="fn-10">10</a>.</dt>
	<dd>As will be seen, the devas, (none of whom, of course, are enlightened) are at various stages of spiritual development. This one is clearly not very advanced!</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-11" id="fn-11">11</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The hour Samiddhi means is that of his death.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-12" id="fn-12">12</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Kaalika:</i> "concerned with time" ("time-ish": Mrs. Rhys Davids). The deva probably means "there is time for all that as you are young," but the word is no doubt introduced together with <i>sandi.t.thika</i> (here rendered "the present moment") to enable Samiddhi to quote the standard formula on the Dhamma (<a href="#fn-13">n. 13</a>).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-13" id="fn-13">13</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Sandi.t.thiko akaaliko ehipassiko opanayiko paccata.m veditabbo vi&ntilde;&ntilde;uuhi. Sandi.t.thiko</i> lit means "visible" but has the sense of "present, at the present time, in this life"; <i>akaaliko</i> "timeless" can mean both "immediate" and "not involving time, outside of time," <i>ehi-passiko</i> = "come-and-see-ish"; <i>opanayiko</i> (from <i>upa-neti</i> "leads towards") means "leading to the goal." The Dhamma as Truth can only be realized individually by insight.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-14" id="fn-14">14</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Mrs Rhys Davids says "The Buddha rebukes the fairy [see below, <a href="#fn-16">n. 16</a>] for her suggestive ambiguities." But the real ambiguity lies deeper than such frivolity, being concerned with the difference between conventional truth (<i>sammuti-sacca</i>) which takes beings, etc., as being real, and the ultimate truth (<i>paramattha-sacca</i>) which does not (see also <a href="#passage-5">&sect; 5</a>, <i>The Arahant</i>).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-15" id="fn-15">15</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Sace vijaanaasi</i>: Mrs. Rhys Davids renders "If thou knowest [such a man]." But the clear meaning is "if you can grasp this distinction," which is how the she-deva takes it, admitting that she cannot.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-16" id="fn-16">16</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"Fairy": <i>yakkhii,</i> a female <i>yakkha</i>. These (Sanskrit <i>yak.sa</i>) are somewhat ambiguous creatures, sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful to man, though later they are thought of as demons (see PED). There is doubtless an implied rebuke in the Buddha's choice of this form of address. "Fairy" (also an ambivalent expression) is probably the best word here (as used by Mrs. Rhys Davids).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-17" id="fn-17">17</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The three forms of conceit (<i>maana</i>) are to think one is equal to, less than, or better than another. All three are due to the ego-illusion (see <a href="#passage-30">&sect; 30</a>).</dd>

	<dd>She has, according to SA, rightly discerned the Middle Way between self-indulgence and self-torture. In fact, it looks as if her understanding is still somewhat limited: she has, however, grasped the fact that she was indulging in wrong speech at the ethical, if not the ontological level referred to by the Buddha, and she has also understood that one should "leave desires." If she has been cured of her frivolity, that at least is a good start!</dd>

It may however be a false Sanskritization for <i>Bodhi-sakta</i> (which would also be <i>Bodhi-satta</i> in Pali) "one who is attached to or desires to gain Enlightenment."

	<dd><i>Hiina.m:</i> This is the adjective used in the term "Hiinayaana," as contrasted with the designation "Mahaayaana," for the developed or expanded Buddhism of the Northern schools. Curiously enough, it is often adopted today by Oriental Theravaada Buddhists themselves, despite the fact that it is both offensive and erroneous. The facts are set out succinctly in E. J. Thomas, <i>History of Buddhist Thought</i> (London 1933), 177f. According to Thomas, <i>yaana</i> in this context means not "vehicle," as usually translated, but "career." Thus Mahaayaana designates the "great career" of the Bodhisattva (cf. <a href="#fn-51">n. 51</a>) as distinct from the "disciples career" (<i>sraavaka-yaana;</i> Pali <i>saavaka-yaana</i>) and the career culminating in the status of "solitary Buddha" (<i>Pratyeka-Buddha;</i> Pali <i>Pacceka-Buddha</i>), who is enlightened but does not teach. The word <i>hiinayaana</i> "low or base career" is "a term which has become popularized as the translation of a phrase used by Chinese pilgrims, who seem to have known it as a convenient name for all schools which were not Mahaayaana. But this is not the way the term is used in the Sanskrit texts" (Thomas). It is time the opprobrious term was dropped altogether, and especially with regard to Theravaada, a school almost certainly unknown to those who coined it. It mainly referred to the long-extinct Sarvaastivaadins (cf. n 65).</dd>

	<dd>This sutta, as E.J. Thomas (<i>Early Buddhist Scriptures</i>, London 1935, p. 123) says, "has been appealed to both by those who would find in Buddhism the doctrine of something permanent in addition to the five groups [i.e., the <i>sankhaaras</i>], and also by those who deny it." To the former party belong, e.g., H.C. Warren, who included it in his <i>Buddhism in Translations</i> (Harvard 1896, rep. 1963), and Erich Frauwallner, who prints in his <i>Philosophie des Buddhismus</i> [East] Berlin 1956, p. 25f. a German translation from the Chinese version of Tsa Ahan (Taisho 99, k. 3) which he entitles "Das Sutra vom Lasttrager" ("The Sutra of the Burden-Bearer") with the Sanskrit heading (retranslated from the Chinese!) <i>Bhaarahaarasuutram</i>. But Woodward in KS, countering a similar view expressed by A.B. Keith, says: "No bearer of the burden is mentioned at all, but a bearing. <i>Haaro</i> is "a taking." <i>The puggalo ["person"] is the taking hold of the fivefold mass</i>." (Woodward's italics). Woodward's view is expressly supported by Mrs Rhys Davids, as editor, in a note of her own, though she doubtless changed her mind about this later, having subsequently (as is well known) drifted into wrong views! The sutta is discussed briefly twice in EB, and, curiously, different opinions are expressed on this point. Under <i>Bhaara</i>, U. K[arunaratana] says: "the burden-bearer (<i>bhaarahaara</i>) is the person (<i>puggala</i>)," while under <i>Bhaara Sutta</i> L[akshmi] R. G[oonesekere] writes: "the 'laying hold of the burden' [=<i>bharahara</i>] is the individual." Grammar would seem to be on the side of the latter view, and while I am unable to say whether Frauwallner has translated from the Chinese correctly or not, the same would apply to the Sanskrit title he quotes. It is further noteworthy that in Frauwallner's text the four things are given in a different order from the Pali as: "The Burden," "the taking up of the burden" (but see <a href="#fn-121">n. 121</a>), "the laying down of the burden," and "the bearer of the burden" [=<i>bhaarahaara.</i>] The last of these three is said to be "the person," etc., but with a somewhat expanded description. The final verses are also somewhat different. In any case the Sanskrit text (on which the Chinese version is based) is clearly secondary.
	<p>It is easy to understand how this sutta could be misunderstood, both in ancient and in modern times, since (doctrinal issues apart!) one would expect the "person" to be described as the bearer rather than the "bearing." The explanation is that the "person" is in terms of relative truth what the <i>khandhas</i> are according to ultimate truth (cf. <a href="#fn-14">n. 14</a>).</p>
	<p>One is tempted to think that this sutta was originally delivered for the benefit of one or other of the Bhaaradvaajas (see Nos 10, 11, 42), whose name appears to mean "twice-born burden"!</p>

Descartes identified himself with, in Buddhist terms, <i>vicaara</i> "discursive thought," which belongs to the "mental formations" group (<i>sankhaarakkhandha</i>). When Goethe (whom many would consider a greater thinker than Descartes) said "Gefuhl ist alles" ("Feeling is everything"), it might be thought that (at that moment) he was identifying himself with the "feeling" group (<i>vedanaakhandha</i>).

The suffering inherent in the formations has its roots in the imperfectability of all conditioned existence, and in the fact that there cannot be any final satisfaction within the incessant turning of the Wheel of Life.

	<dd>These are the four standard objects of mindfulness.</dd>

	<dd><i>Pa.nidhaaya</i>. The difference between the two kinds of meditation is that between concentration on an object (<i>samaadhi</i>) and "choiceless awareness," which is <i>sati</i>. See <a href="#fn-237">n. 237</a>. For a full account of this practice, see Nyanaponika Thera, <i>The Heart of Buddhist Meditation</i>, London 1962.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-287" id="fn-287">287.</a></dt>
	<dd>Such as the object previously envisaged. SA says <i>kammatthaana</i> "the meditation object."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-288" id="fn-288">288.</a></dt>
	<dd>Woodward considers that "before" means the practice, and "after" means its goal, i.e., Nibbaana. More probably it means keeping his mind in the present moment, dwelling neither on the past nor on the future.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-289" id="fn-289">289.</a></dt>
	<dd><i>Paa.timokkha</i>, the monastic code of conduct, now enshrined in the 227 rules which are recited fortnightly.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-290" id="fn-290">290.</a></dt>
	<dd><i>Acaara-gocara-sampanno</i>, i.e., "having perfected the training up to the stage you have reached."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-291" id="fn-291">291.</a></dt>
	<dd>Reading with Woodward <i>sikkhaahi</i> "train yourself" (imperative) instead of Feer's <i>sikkhasi</i>.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-292" id="fn-292">292.</a></dt>
	<dd><i>Siila:</i> "disciplined behavior."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-293" id="fn-293">293.</a></dt>
	<dd>These are, of course, the five senses recognized in the West, to which Buddhism adds mind as the sixth.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-294" id="fn-294">294.</a></dt>
	<dd><i>Patisara.na.m</i>. "Resort" is a somewhat desperate attempt (after Woodward) to find an equivalent. Probably not from <i>sara.na</i> "refuge" but from <i>sarati</i> (PED) in the sense of "referring back." Woodward refers to DN 3, I, 28 (final verse) (=<i>Dial.</i> i, 122n.). The word is rendered "repository" by I. B. Horner at MLS 43 (SN i. 355). In a somewhat similar context in M44, <i>patibhaaga</i> ("counterpart": I. B. Horner, MLS i, 367) is used.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-295" id="fn-295">295.</a></dt>
	<dd>At first glance one might suppose that U.n.naabha was either thinking in terms of a "self" or trying to trap the Buddha into admitting the existence of one, but since we learn that he was an <i>anaagaamin</i> (<a href="#fn-300">n. 300</a>), this is not so. Cf. <a href="#passage-36">&sect; 36</a>.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-296" id="fn-296">296.</a></dt>
	<dd>This may in effect be a play on words, since <i>patisara.na.m</i> here can well be taken as "protection," i.e., differently derived from that in <a href="#fn-294">n. 294</a>. Something of the effect could be achieved by rendering above: "to what (<i>or</i> whom) do the faculties <i>report</i>?, and here: "to what (whom) does mind <i>resort</i> (for protection)?"</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-297" id="fn-297">297.</a></dt>
	<dd>Here rather in the sense of <a href="#fn-294">n. 294</a>. Cf. the discussion by Mrs Rhys Davids in BPE, introduction, p. lxxxvii.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-298" id="fn-298">298.</a></dt>
	<dd>The "immersion" is of course metaphorical, since there is nothing, and nobody, that "enters" Nibbaana! We may compare the well-known concluding line of Sir Edwin Arnold's <i>The Light of Asia</i>:
	<p>"The dewdrop slips into the shining sea."</p>
	</dd>
	
<dt><a href="#fnt-299" id="fn-299">299.</a></dt>
	<dd>Woodward translates too literally "were to make an end," which suggests suicide. This is not implied by <i>kaala.m kareyya</i>, which is merely an idiomatic expression for dying.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-300" id="fn-300">300.</a></dt>
	<dd>This means that he is an <i>anaagaamin</i> or "Non-Returner" who, having destroyed the five lower fetters (see <a href="../ireland/wheel107.html#fn-83">Vol. I, n. 83</a>), will not return to this world.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-301" id="fn-301">301.</a></dt>
	<dd>Reverting to <i>jangalaana.m</i> in Feer's text, as opposed to Woodward's "creatures as roam about" based a dubious <i>jangaman.am</i> (for <i>cankamana.m</i>) of some MSS.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-302" id="fn-302">302.</a></dt>
	<dd><i>Padaani</i> lit. "feet" is an untranslatable pun. <i>Pada.m</i> "foot" has even more metaphorical meanings in Pali than the English word: see PED.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-303" id="fn-303">303.</a></dt>
	<dd><i>Pa&ntilde;&ntilde;indriya</i>. The fifth of the five "spiritual faculties": 1. Faith (<i>saddhaa</i>), 2. Energy (<i>viriya</i>), 3. Mindfulness (<i>sati</i>), 4. Concentration (<i>samaadhi</i>), 5. Wisdom (<i>pa&ntilde;&ntilde;aa</i>). See BD s.v. <i>Indriya</i> and also <i>Indriya-samatta</i>. It will be noticed that these five partly overlap with the seven <i>bojjhangas</i> (<a href="#fn-260">n. 260</a>).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-304" id="fn-304">304.</a></dt>
	<dd>These are, of course, the standard formulations for referring to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. They seem to fit awkwardly into the context here and may have been interpolated.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-305" id="fn-305">305.</a></dt>
	<dd>These terms are used of Saariputta at SN 2.9 (not translated here). Cf. the distinction between difficult and easy progress in VM XXI, 117.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-306" id="fn-306">306.</a></dt>
	<dd>Theosophists and others maintain that rebirth as an animal, after a human existence, is impossible. This view is not supported by the Buddhist texts of any school.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-307" id="fn-307">307.</a></dt>
	<dd>Cf. <a href="#fn-300">n. 300</a>. This is the <i>anaagaamin</i> or "Non-Returner."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-308" id="fn-308">308.</a></dt>
	<dd>I.e., not born from a womb by spontaneously arising in another world (in this case the "Pure Abodes" (<i>suddhaavaasaa</i>), where they will attain to final release without returning to this world).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-309" id="fn-309">309.</a></dt>
	<dd>These are the first three of the five lower fetters (<i>orambhaagiya-sa.myojanaani</i> <a href="../ireland/wheel107.html#fn-83">Vol. I, n. 83</a>), i.e., <i>sakkaaya-di.t.thi</i> "personality-view" or belief in a permanent, really existing self; <i>vicikicchaa</i> "doubt" (once the "personality-view" has been shattered, there can be no further fundamental doubt about the Dhamma); and <i>siilabbata-paraamaasa</i> "attachment to rites and rituals" (<i>siila</i> + <i>vata</i>). It is noteworthy that even at this (second) stage on the Path, sensuality (<i>kaamaraaga</i>) and ill-will (<i>vyaapaada</i>), the fourth and fifth fetters, are only weakened but not destroyed. Their destruction is, however, inevitable.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-310" id="fn-310">310.</a></dt>
	<dd>An encouraging message for many! Cf. the end of <a href="../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html">MN 22</a>, and also the charming image of the new-born calf in MN 34. The Commentary (MA) to MN 22 says such people are termed "lesser stream-winners" (<i>cuulasotaapannaa</i>). This term is discussed in VM XIX, 27. The stress laid here on the importance of faith is interesting in view of later developments such as the Pure Land Schools (e.g., Jodo-Shishu or "Shin-Buddhism" in Japan).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-311" id="fn-311">311.</a></dt>

	<dd>This famous saying has been taken to justify the doctrines of various Mahaayaana schools, Theosophy and so on. While it may do so in many cases, the real meaning is somewhat different. The Buddha was naturally aware of many things, unknown to others, which he did not deem it necessary to teach for the gaining of enlightenment. We can accept, even without interpreting full enlightenment vulgarly as "omniscience," that the Buddha was at least potentially aware of whatever he wished or needed to know. He knew precisely which religious and philosophical doctrines that were or might be propounded were (<i>a</i>) true and (<i>b</i>) conducive to enlightenment. He borrowed nothing, as such, from previous systems because he did not need to, but he gave his approval to whatever conformed to these criteria.
	<p>It has occasionally been urged that if the Buddha was really all-enlightened, he must have been able to foresee modern scientific discoveries. In fact, he probably could have done so, but that was not his task, and he will certainly have been more aware than such critics of the dangers inherent in modern discoveries, with their power not only to destroy but also to corrupt. As a matter of fact he did not even utilize a very basic technical device which was known in his time &mdash; the art of writing. He clearly preferred that his teachings should be preserved orally by those attempting to practice them and indeed the oral tradition has continued to this day. (Cf. T.W. Rhys Davids, <i>Buddhist India</i>, London 1903, pp. 107ff.). There is, however, one "modern science" which the Buddha not only anticipated but far surpassed: psychology. The superiority of Buddhist psychological insights to the findings of the West can be readily verified (some examples can be found in this Anthology). Cf. Nyanaponika Thera <i>Abhidhamma Studies</i> (BPS 1965), and Douglas M. Burns, <i>Buddhist Meditation and Depth Psychology</i> (WH 88-89).</p>
	<p>We may compare the saying quoted here with another, no less famous one occurring at SN 47.9 (not included in this Anthology) as well as in the <i>Mahaparinibbana Sutta</i>, <i>Dial</i>. 16, II, 25 (= D ii, 100): <i>Desito Aananda mayaa dhammo anantaram abaahiram katvaa. natth'Aananda Tathaagatassa dhammesu aacariyamutthi</i> "I have taught Dhamma, Ananda, making no 'inner' and 'outer': the Tathaagata has no 'teacher's fist' in respect of the doctrines." There is, of course, no contradiction between the two statements, which in fact point once again to the middle way between the extremes. Both equally imply that whatever else the Buddha may have been aware of about the world, he taught just what was needed for the gaining of enlightenment, holding back nothing, but refraining from imparting irrelevant information. As the life of the monks was pared down to essentials, so was the teaching.</p>
	<p>It is fair to suggest that here, in the Pali Canon, we have the Buddhist teaching presented in its purest and simplest form, in the words of the Teacher himself. This statement is not meant to be in any way polemical, or to claim that doctrines developed in the later, so-called Mahaayaana schools are necessarily wrong. Recent research, indeed, has conclusively shown that the germ of many such doctrines can be traced back to the Pali Canon. For instance, there is little real conflict between the ideas expressed by Naagaarjuna, founder of the Madhyamika school, and the Theravaada (a school with which he was almost certainly entirely unacquainted). Likewise, while the proposition recently put forward that Zen is the "Theravaada of Japan" can scarcely be literally maintained, the idea nevertheless contains a strong element of truth, since Zen visibly represents and effort to rid later Buddhism of some of the accretions that had tended to obscure the original message. Zen, too, inclines more to something like the Arahant ideal of Theravaada than to that of the Bodhisattva. On the other hand, it should not be overlooked that the Bodhisattva career is one that is open to followers of the Theravaada school (cf. <a href="#fn-51">n. 51</a> and the work of Bhikkhu Bodhi there mentioned; also the Ven. W. Rahula's <i>Zen and the Taming of the Bull</i> (Bedford 1978). And, as indicated in <a href="#fn-310">n. 310</a>, even the apparently extremist Pure Land schools with their emphasis on faith receive rather more support from the Pali Canon than is sometimes thought. In this context K. Mizuno, <i>Primitive Buddhism</i>, tranl. K. Yamamoto (Oyama 1969) is of interest.</p>
	<p>Finally, in connection with the relation of "Buddhism and Science," the wise words of an American astronaut, Ed Mitchell, in a recent TV program may be quoted. He said: "Science is a methodology. As a belief system, it is disastrous." Buddhism, it may be urged, is a spiritual methodology analogous to that of physical science, which makes the acceptance of <i>any</i> pure "belief system" superfluous.</p>
