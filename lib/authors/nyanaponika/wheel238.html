<p>"There are eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving. What eight?</p>
<p>"Herein, monks, a certain person makes a gift to a recluse or a brahman, offering him food, drink, garments, a vehicle, flowers, incense, ointment, bedding, housing or lighting. In making the gift, he hopes for a reward. He now notices noblemen of wealth, brahmans of wealth or householders of wealth, provided with the five sense pleasures and enjoying them. And he thinks: 'Oh, may I be reborn among them, when I die, when this body breaks up!' And he sets his mind on that thought, keeps to it firmly and fosters it. This thought of his aims at what is low,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-7' id='fnt-8-7'>[7]</a> and if not developed to what is higher,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-8' id='fnt-8-8'>[8]</a> it will lead him to just such a rebirth. After his death, when his body breaks up, he will be reborn among wealthy noblemen, wealthy brahmans or wealthy householders. This, however, I declare only for the virtuous, not for the unvirtuous;<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-9' id='fnt-8-9'>[9]</a> for it is due to his purity, monks, that the heart's desire of the virtuous succeeds.</p>
<p>"Then again, a certain person makes a gift to a recluse or a brahman, offering him food... or lighting. In making the gift, he hopes for a reward. He now hears of the long life, the beauty and the great happiness of deities in the realm of the Four Great Divine Kings &mdash; the Thirty-three gods &mdash; the Yaama gods &mdash; the Tusita gods &mdash; the gods of creative joy &mdash; the gods controlling others' creations, and he wishes to be reborn among them. He sets his mind on that thought, keeps to it firmly and fosters it. This thought of his aims at what is low, and if not developed to what is higher, it will lead him to just such a rebirth. After his death, when his body breaks up, he will be reborn among the deities in the realm of the Four Great Divine Kings... the gods controlling others' creations. This, however, I declare only for the virtuous, not for the unvirtuous; for it is due to his purity, monks, that the heart's desire of the virtuous succeeds.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There are, monks, three ways of making merit.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-11' id='fnt-8-11'>[11]</a> What three?</p>
<p>"There are ways of making merit by giving, by (practicing) virtue and by meditation.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-12' id='fnt-8-12'>[12]</a></p>
<p>"There is a person who, only to a small degree, has practiced the making of merit by giving; and, likewise to a small degree, he has practiced the making of merit by virtue; but the making of merit by meditation he has not undertaken.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-13' id='fnt-8-13'>[13]</a> This one, after death, when his body breaks up, will be reborn among humans in an ill-favored condition.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-14' id='fnt-8-14'>[14]</a></p>
<p>"Another person has practiced to a high degree the making of merit by giving as well as by virtue; but the making of merit by meditation he has not undertaken. Such a one, after death, when his body breaks up, will be reborn among humans in favorable conditions.</p>
<p>"Or he will be reborn in the company of the deities of the Four Great Divine Kings. And there, the Four Great Divine Kings, who had practiced to a very high degree the making of merit by giving and by virtue, surpass the deities of their realm in ten things: in divine life span, divine beauty, divine happiness, divine power, divine sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.</p>
<p>"Or he will be reborn in the company of the Thirty-three gods. And there, Sakka king of gods, who had practiced to a very high degree the making of merit by giving and virtue, surpasses...</p>
<p><i>(The same statements are made for rebirth among the Yaama gods, Tusita gods, the gods of creative joy, the gods controlling others' creations, and for the respective rulers of these realms.)</i></p>

<h3><a id='passage-5'>5. Outcomes of Merit</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-8'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There are, monks, eight outcomes of merit and goodness which are the nourishment of happiness and are very precious; they yield happiness, lead heavenwards, and bring about what is desirable, pleasing, agreeable and enjoyable. What are these eight?</p>
<p>"Herein, monks, a noble disciple goes for refuge to the Buddha. This is the first outcome of merit and goodness which is a nourishment of happiness and is very precious; it yields happiness, leads heavenwards and brings about what is desirable, pleasing, agreeable and enjoyable.</p>
<p>"There is further a noble disciple who has gone for refuge to the Teaching... to the Order of Monks. This is the second outcome... the third outcome...</p>
<p>"There are further, monks, these five gifts, known from early times, known for long, known by tradition, ancient and unrejected; not rejected before, they are not rejected now and will not be rejected in future; they are unrepudiated by intelligent recluses and brahmans. What are these five gifts?</p>
<p>"Herein, monks, a noble disciple gives up the taking of life and abstains from it. By abstaining from the taking of life, the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear, gives to them freedom from hostility, gives to them freedom from oppression. By giving to immeasurable beings freedom from fear, hostility and oppression, he himself will enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear, hostility, and oppression. This is the first of those great gifts and the fourth of the outcomes of merit.</p>
<p>"Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up the taking of what is not given and abstains from it. By abstaining from what is not given, the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear... This is the second of those great gifts and the fifth of the outcomes of merit.</p>
<p>"Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up sexual misconduct and abstains from it. By abstaining from sexual misconduct, the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear... This is the third of those great gifts and the sixth of the outcomes of merit.</p>
<p>"Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up wrong speech and abstains from it. By abstaining from wrong speech, the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear... This is the fourth of those great gifts and the seventh of the outcomes of merit.</p>
<p>"Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up intoxicating drink and drugs causing heedlessness, and abstains from them. By abstaining from intoxicating drink and drugs, the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear, freedom from hostility and freedom from oppression. By giving to immeasurable beings freedom from fear, hostility and oppression, he himself will enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear, freedom from hostility and freedom from oppression. This is the fifth of those great gifts and the eighth of the outcomes of merit.</p>
<p>"These, monks, are the eight outcomes of merit and goodness which are the nourishment of happiness and are very precious; they yield happiness, lead heavenwards and bring about what is desirable, pleasing, agreeable and enjoyable."</p>

<h3><a id='passage-6'>6. Mindfulness of Death (I)</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-8'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Once the Blessed One was staying in the Brick Hall at Naadikaa. There he addressed the monks as follows:</p>
<p>"Mindfulness of death, monks, if cultivated and frequently practiced, brings great fruit, great benefit; it merges in the Deathless, ends in the Deathless. Therefore, monks, you should cultivate mindfulness of death."</p>
<p>After these words of the Blessed One, a certain monk said:</p>
<p>"Lord, I cultivate mindfulness of death." &mdash; "And how do you cultivate it?"</p>
<p>"I am thinking in this way, Lord: 'Oh, were I to live just for one day and a night, I would direct my mind on the Blessed One's teaching. Much, indeed, could then be done by me!' Thus, Lord, do I cultivate mindfulness of death."</p>
<p><i>(Other monks in that assembly likewise said that they cultivated mindfulness of death and, being asked how they did so, they answered:)</i></p>
<p>"I am thinking in this way, Lord: 'Oh, were I to live but for a single day... half-a-day... just for the time I need to eat one alms meal... half an alms meal... just for the time I need to chew and swallow four or five morsels of food... just for the time I need to chew and swallow one morsel of food... just for the time I breathe in after the out-breath or breathe out after the in-breath, I would direct my mind on the Blessed One's teaching. Much, indeed, could then be done by me!' Thus, Lord, do I cultivate mindfulness of death."</p>
<p>After the monks had thus spoken, the Blessed One said:</p>
<p>"The monks who say that they cultivate mindfulness of death with the thought, 'Oh, were I to live just for one day and a night... just for the time needed to chew and swallow four or five morsels of food...' &mdash; of these monks it must be said that they live indolently and that, for the aim of destroying the taints,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-15' id='fnt-8-15'>[15]</a> they cultivate mindfulness of death in a slack way.</p>
<p>"But, monks, those who cultivate mindfulness of death with the thought, 'Oh, were I to live for the time I need to chew and swallow one morsel of food; or for the time of breathing in after the out-breath or breathing out after the in-breath, I would direct my mind on the Blessed One's teaching. Much, indeed, could then be done by me!' &mdash; of these monks it can be said that they live diligently, and that, for the aim of destroying the taints, they cultivate mindfulness of death ardently.</p>
<p>"Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves thus, 'Diligently shall we live and, for the aim of destroying the taints, we shall cultivate mindfulness of death in an ardent way!' Thus, indeed, O monks, you should train yourselves." </p>

<h3><a id='passage-7'>7. Mindfulness of Death (II)</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-8'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Once the Blessed One was staying in the Brick Hall at Naadikaa. There he addressed the monks as follows:</p>
<p>"Mindfulness of death, monks, if cultivated and frequently practiced, brings great fruit, great benefit; it merges in the Deathless, ends in the Deathless. And how, monks, is it cultivated (in that way)?</p>
<p>"When, monks, the day fades and night sets in... or when the night is spent and the day breaks, a monk should reflect thus: 'Many might be the causes of my death: a snake or a scorpion or a centipede may sting me, and through that I may die. This would be a hindrance to me.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8-16' id='fnt-8-16'>[16]</a> Or I may stumble and have a fall; or the food I ate may cause illness; or bile, phlegm, or piercing (pains of body-) gases may upset my health; humans or non-humans may assault me; and through this I may die. That would be a hindrance to me.'</p>
<p>"Then that monk should further reflect thus: 'Do I harbor in myself any evil and unwholesome qualities, which are still undiscarded and would be a hindrance to me if I were to die tonight or during the day?'</p>
<p>"If, on reflection, that monk realizes that those evil, unwholesome qualities are still in him, then he should, with strong resolve, apply all his effort, vigor and exertion, (together with) mindfulness and clear comprehension, for the sake of discarding them.</p>
<p>"Just as a man whose turban or hair is on fire will, to extinguish the fire, with strong resolve, apply all his effort, vigor and exertion, (together with) mindfulness and clear comprehension; even so should that monk resolutely apply all his effort... for discarding his evil and unwholesome qualities.</p>
<p>"But if, on reflection, that monk realizes that there are in him no such evil and unwholesome qualities that might be a hindrance to him if he were to die tonight or during the day, then he may well feel gladness and joy. By day and night he should train himself in everything that is beneficial.</p>
<p>"If, monks, mindfulness of death is cultivated in that way, and is frequently practiced, it will bring great fruit, great benefit, and it will merge in the Deathless, will end in the Deathless."</p>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8-4" id="fn-8-4">4</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"By softening the heart of the giver and the recipient" (Comy.). Some of the "ways of giving" mentioned in this and the following text refer specifically to the gift of a meal to monks, but not exclusively so. Some of the items have a general application. In Sri Lanka the Pali word <i>daana</i> (giving, gifts) is commonly used for an alms meal offered to Buddhist monks; but in the Pali scriptures the usage is not restricted in that way. On the subject of giving, see in this Anthology, Part I (Wheel No. 155/158), 28, 53; in Part II (Wheel No. 208/211), 8.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8-5" id="fn-8-5">5</a>.</dt>

	<dd><i>Mohena</i>. For foolish reasons; or in an unintelligent or absent-minded way.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8-7" id="fn-8-7">7</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Aims at what is low.</i> Comy.: That is, at the low (level of the) five sense-objects.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8-8" id="fn-8-8">8</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Uttari abhaavita.m</i>. Comy.: "His mind has not been developed beyond that, i.e., towards the holy path and fruitions (of stream-entry, etc.)."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8-9" id="fn-8-9">9</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Sub. Comy.: "This is meant to indicate that immorality would create an impediment, and that it is not solely the meritorious act consisting of giving that leads to such a favorable rebirth."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8-10" id="fn-8-10">10</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Free of lust</i> (<i>viitaraagassa</i>)<i>.</i> Comy.: That is, one who is free of lust (for sensuality) either by having eradicated it (<i>samucchinna-raagassa</i>) by the path of non-return; or by having repressed it (<i>vikkhambhita</i>) by a meditative attainment. For one cannot be reborn in a Brahma-world solely by giving (liberality; <i>daana</i>). Giving, however, is an ennobling and supportive factor in a state of mind directed to tranquillity and insight (<i>samatha-vipassanaa</i>). If one practices the <i>brahma-vihaara</i> (divine abidings) with a mind that has become gentle by giving, one will be reborn in the Brahma-world." &mdash; Sub. Comy.: "The term 'free of lust' (<i>viitaraaga</i>) refers here only to the eradication of sensuous desire (<i>kaama-raaga</i>), by which a rebirth in a Brahma-world may well take place; but such a rebirth cannot occur by the eradication of the desire for (renewed) existence (<i>bhava-raaga</i>)."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8-11" id="fn-8-11">11</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Pu~n~naa-kiriya-vatthu</i>. The term <i>vatthu</i> can also be rendered by basis, item or type. Comy. says that these three are bases for their respective benefits. &mdash; Later tradition adds another seven items; on these see "The Advantages of Merit," by Bhikkhu Khantipalo (Bodhi Leaves No. 38).</dd>

<h3><a id='passage-8'>8. Meghiya</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-9'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Once the Blessed One lived at Caalikaa, on the Caaliya hill.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-1' id='fnt-9-1'>[1]</a> There the venerable Meghiya, who was at that time the Blessed One's attendant, approached the Master, saluted him respectfully, and while standing at one side, said:</p>
<p>"Lord, I wish to go to Jantugaama for alms food." &mdash; "You may do as you think fit, Meghiya."</p>
<p>The venerable Meghiya, dressing himself in the morning and taking robe and bowl, entered Jantugaama for alms food. Having made the alms round and taken his meal, he went to the bank of the Kimikaalaa river.</p>
<p>There, while walking about to stretch his legs, he saw a pleasant and beautiful mango grove. Seeing it, he thought: "Pleasant, indeed, is this mango grove; it is beautiful. Truly, it is fit for a clansman who wishes to make effort (in meditation). If the Blessed One allows it, I shall return to this mango grove for my efforts (in meditation)."</p>
<p>And the venerable Meghiya went to see the Blessed One, saluted him respectfully and sat down to one side. He then said: "Lord, after my alms round in Jantugaama, when I had taken my meal, I went to the bank of the river Kimikaalaa and while walking there I saw a pleasant and beautiful mango grove which I thought fit for a clansman who wishes to make effort (in meditation). If the Blessed One permits, I shall go there and strive.</p>
<p>"Wait for a while, Meghiya. We are now alone here.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-2' id='fnt-9-2'>[2]</a> First let another monk come."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-3' id='fnt-9-3'>[3]</a></p>
<p>But the venerable Meghiya repeated his request, saying: "Lord, for the Blessed One there is nothing further to achieve and nothing needs to be added to his achievement. But as for me, Lord, there is still more that I have to achieve and more to be added to what I have done. If the Blessed One permits, I shall go to that mango grove and strive."</p>
<p>Again the Blessed One asked him to wait and again the venerable Meghiya made his request for a third time.</p>
<p>"As you speak of striving, Meghiya, what can we say? You may do now as you think fit."</p>
<p>The venerable Meghiya then rose from his seat, saluted the Blessed One, and keeping him to his right, left for the mango grove. Having arrived, he went deeper into the grove and sat down under a tree to spend the day there. But while staying in that mango grove, three evil, unwholesome thoughts constantly assailed him: sensual thoughts, thoughts of aversion and thoughts of aggressiveness.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-4' id='fnt-9-4'>[4]</a></p>
<p>Then he thought: "Truly, it is strange, it is amazing! In faith have I gone forth from home into the homeless life and yet I am harassed by these three evil, unwholesome thoughts; thoughts of sensuality, of aversion and of aggressiveness!"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-5' id='fnt-9-5'>[5]</a></p>
<p>Then the venerable Meghiya went back to the Blessed One, and having saluted him, he told him what had occurred and he exclaimed: "Truly it is strange, it is amazing! In faith have I gone forth from home into the homeless life and yet I am harassed by these three evil, unwholesome thoughts!"</p>
<p>"If, Meghiya, the mind still lacks maturity for liberation, there are five conditions conducive to making it mature. What five?</p>
<p>"The first thing, Meghiya, for making the immature mind mature for liberation is to have a noble friend, a noble companion, a noble associate.</p>
<p>"Further, Meghiya, a monk should be virtuous; his life should be disciplined by the code of his monastic rules; his conduct should be proper and also his resort;<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-6' id='fnt-9-6'>[6]</a> seeing danger in the slightest fault, he should train himself in the rules he has accepted. This is the second thing making the immature mind mature for liberation.</p>
<p>"Further, Meghiya, the talk in which a monk engages should befit an austere life and be helpful to mental clarity; that is to say, it should be talk on wanting little, on contentment, on solitude, on seclusion, on application of energy, on virtue, concentration, wisdom, deliverance, and on the knowledge and vision of deliverance. If a monk has easily, without difficulty, opportunities for such talk, this is the third thing making the immature mind mature for liberation.</p>
<p>"Further, Meghiya, a monk lives with his energy set upon the abandoning of everything harmful and the acquiring of everything beneficial; he is steadfast and firm in his efforts, not shirking the task as to (cultivating) things beneficial. This is the fourth thing making the immature mind mature for liberation.</p>
<p>"Further, Meghiya, a monk possesses wisdom; he is equipped with the wisdom that perceives the rise and fall (of conditioned things), which is noble and penetrating and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is the fifth thing making the immature mind mature for liberation.</p>
<p>"Of a monk, Meghiya, who has a noble friend, a noble companion and associate, it can be expected that he will be virtuous... that he will engage in talk befitting the austere life and helpful to mental clarity... that his energy will be set upon the abandoning of everything harmful and the acquiring of everything beneficial... that he will be equipped with the wisdom that leads to the complete destruction of suffering.</p>
<p>"Then, Meghiya, when the monk is firmly grounded in these five things, he should cultivate another four things: he should cultivate the reflection on the impurity (of the body) for abandoning lust; he should cultivate loving-kindness for abandoning aversion; he should cultivate mindfulness of breathing for cutting off (distracting) thoughts; he should cultivate the perception of impermanence for eliminating the conceit 'I am.' In one who perceives impermanence, the perception of egolessness becomes firmly established; and one who perceives egolessness attains to the elimination of the conceit 'I am' and, in this very life, he reaches Nibbaana."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-7' id='fnt-9-7'>[7]</a></p>

<h3><a id='passage-9'>9. Freed of Fivefold Fear</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-9'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There are, monks, four powers. The power of wisdom, the power of energy, the power of an unblemished life,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-8' id='fnt-9-8'>[8]</a> and the power of benevolence.</p>
<p>"And what, monks, is the power of wisdom? As to those things which are good and held to be good, bad and held to be so; blameless and blameworthy, and held to be so; dark and bright, and held to be so; fit or unfit to be practiced, and held to be so; which are worthy and unworthy of noble ones, and are held to be so &mdash; to see all these things clearly and to consider them well, this is called the power of wisdom.</p>
<p>"And what, monks, is the power of energy? As to those things that are bad, blameworthy, dark, unfit to be practiced, unworthy of noble ones, and which are held to be so &mdash; to rouse one's will, to make an effort and stir up one's energy for giving up all these things; and as to those things that are good, blameless, bright, fit to be practiced, worthy of noble ones, and which are held to be so &mdash; to rouse one's will, to make an effort and stir up one's energy for gaining all these things &mdash; this is called the power of energy.</p>
<p>"And what, monks, is the power of an unblemished life? Herein, monks, a noble disciple<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-9' id='fnt-9-9'>[9]</a> is unblemished in his deeds, unblemished in his words, unblemished in his thoughts. This is called the power of an unblemished life.</p>
<p>"And what, monks, is the power of benevolence? There are four ways of benevolence;<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-10' id='fnt-9-10'>[10]</a> by gifts, by friendly speech, by helpful acts and by bestowal of equity. This is the best of gifts: the gift of Dhamma. And this is the best of friendly speech: to teach again and again Dhamma to those who wish for it and who listen attentively. And this is the best of helpful acts: to arouse, instil and strengthen faith in the unbeliever; to arouse, instil and strengthen virtue in the immoral; to arouse, instil and strengthen generosity in the niggard; to arouse, instil and strengthen wisdom in the unwise. And this is the best bestowal of equity: if a stream-winner becomes equal to a stream-winner; a once-returner equal to a once-returner; a non-returner equal to a non-returner; and an arahant equal to an arahant. This, monks, is called the power of benevolence.</p>
<p>"And this (concludes) the four powers.</p>
<p>"Now, monks, a noble disciple endowed with these four powers has left behind five fears: the fear for his livelihood, the fear of disrepute, the fear of embarrassment in assemblies, the fear of death, and the fear of an unhappy future destiny.</p>
<p>"A noble disciple (thus endowed) will think: 'No fear do I have for my livelihood. Why should I have fear about it? Have I not the four powers of wisdom, energy, unblemished life and benevolence? It is one who is foolish and lazy, of blameworthy conduct in deeds, words and thoughts, and who has no benevolence &mdash; such a one might be in fear for his livelihood.</p>
<p>"'No fear do I have about disrepute or about embarrassment in assemblies, nor have I fear of death or of an unhappy future destiny. Why should I have these fears? Have I not the four powers of wisdom, energy, unblemished life and benevolence? It is one who is foolish and lazy, of blameworthy conduct in deeds, words and thoughts, and who has no benevolence &mdash; such a one might have all these fears.'</p>
<p>"Thus it should be understood, monks, that a noble disciple endowed with the four powers has left behind five fears."</p>

<h3><a id='passage-10'>10. Saariputta's Lion's Roar</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-9'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Once the Blessed One lived at Saavatthii, in the Jeta Grove, in Anaathapi.n.dika's monastery. At that time the venerable Saariputta approached the Blessed One. After saluting him respectfully and being seated, he spoke to the Blessed One thus:</p>
<p>"I have completed now, Lord, the rains sojourn at Saavatthii and I wish to leave for a country journey." &mdash; "Yes, Saariputta, do as you think fit." The venerable Saariputta rose from his seat, saluted the Blessed One, and keeping him to his right, departed.</p>
<p>Soon after the venerable Saariputta had left, one of the monks said to the Blessed One: "The venerable Saariputta has hit me and without an apology has left on a journey."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-11' id='fnt-9-11'>[11]</a></p>
<p>And the Blessed One called another monk and said: "Go, monk, and take my message to the venerable Saariputta, saying, 'The Master calls you, brother Saariputta.'"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-12' id='fnt-9-12'>[12]</a> (The monk did as he was bidden,) and the venerable Saariputta responded, saying, "Yes, brother."</p>
<p>Then the venerable Mahaa-Moggallaana and the venerable Aananda, taking the keys, went around the monks' lodgings and said: "Come, revered sirs, come! For today the venerable Saariputta will utter his lion's roar in the presence of the Blessed One."</p>
<p>The venerable Saariputta approached the Blessed One, and after saluting him, sat down at one side. When he was seated, the Blessed One said: "One of your fellow monks has made here a complaint, saying, 'The venerable Saariputta has hit me and without an apology has left on a journey.'"</p>
<p>"He, Lord, in whom mindfulness directed on the body is not present in regard to body (activity),<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-13' id='fnt-9-13'>[13]</a> such a one may well hit a fellow monk and leave without an apology.</p>
<p>"Just as, Lord, people throw upon the earth things clean and unclean, dung, urine, spittle, pus and blood, yet for all that the earth has no revulsion, loathing or disgust about it; even so, Lord, do I dwell with a heart that is like the earth, wide, extensive and measureless, without hostility and ill-will. However, he in whom mindfulness directed on the body in regard to body (activity) is not present, he could well hit a fellow monk and leave without apology.</p>
<p>"Just as, Lord, people wash in water things clean and unclean, (things soiled with) dung, urine, spittle, pus and blood, yet for all that the water has no revulsion, loathing or disgust about it; even so, Lord, do I dwell with a heart that is like water, wide, extensive and measureless, without hostility and ill-will. However, he in whom...</p>
<p>"Just as, Lord, fire burns things clean and unclean, (things soiled with) dung, urine, spittle, pus and blood, yet for all that the fire has no revulsion, loathing or disgust about it; even so, Lord, do I dwell with a heart that is like fire, wide, extensive and measureless, without hostility and ill-will. However, he in whom...</p>
<p>"Just as, Lord, the wind blows over things clean and unclean, (things soiled with) dung, urine, spittle, pus and blood, yet for all that the wind has no revulsion, loathing or disgust about it; even so, Lord, do I dwell with a heart that is like the wind, wide, extensive and measureless, without hostility and ill-will. However, he in whom... <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-14' id='fnt-9-14'>[14]</a></p>
<p>"Lord, just as a dusting cloth wipes over things clean and unclean, (things soiled with) dung, urine, spittle, pus and blood, yet for all that the dusting cloth has no revulsion, loathing or disgust about it; even so, Lord, do I dwell with a heart that is like a duster, wide, extensive and measureless, without hostility and ill-will. However, he in whom...</p>
<p>"Lord, just as an outcaste<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9-15' id='fnt-9-15'>[15]</a> boy or girl, begging-vessel in hand and clad in rags, enters a village or town with a humble heart; even so, Lord, do I dwell with a heart like that of an outcaste youth, a heart that is wide, extensive and measureless, without hostility and ill-will. However, he in whom...</p>
<p>"Lord, just as a bull with his horns cut, gentle, well tamed and well trained, when roaming from street to street, from crossroad to crossroad, will not hurt anyone with feet or horns; even so, Lord, do I dwell like a bull with horns cut, with a heart that is wide, extensive and measureless, without hostility and ill-will. However, he in whom...</p>
<p>"Lord, just as a woman or man, young, youthful, fond of adornment, who has just washed the head, would be filled with revulsion, loathing and disgust if the carcass of a snake, a dog or a man were to be slung around the neck; even so, Lord, am I filled with revulsion, loathing and disgust for this foul body of mine. However, he in whom mindfulness directed on the body in regard to body (activity) is not present, he could well hit a fellow monk and leave without apology.</p>
<p>"Lord, just as if one were to carry around a bowl of liquid fat that is full of holes and crevices, oozing and dripping; even so, Lord, do I carry along this body that is full of holes and openings, oozing and dripping. However, he in whom mindfulness directed on the body in regard to body (activity) is not present, he could well hit a fellow monk and leave without apology."</p>
<p>Then that (accusing) monk rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and with his head on the ground bowed at the feet of the Blessed One, saying: "Lord, an offense has overcome me, in my foolishness, confusion and badness, insofar as I have accused the venerable Saariputta falsely, wrongly and untruthfully. May, Lord, the Blessed One accept my offense as such (and pardon me), so that in future I may restrain myself."</p>
<p>"Truly, monk, an offense has overcome you in your foolishness, confusion and badness, insofar as you have accused the venerable Saariputta falsely, wrongly and untruthfully. But since you have recognized your offense as such and are making amends according to Dhamma, we accept it from you. It means progress in the discipline of the noble one if a monk recognizes his offense, makes amends and restrains himself in the future."</p>
<p>The Blessed One then turned to the venerable Saariputta and said: "Forgive this foolish man, Saariputta, before his head splits into seven pieces on this very spot!"</p>
<p>"I shall forgive him, Lord, if this revered monk asks for my pardon, and he, too, may forgive me."</p>

Therefore, at the very moment when Meghiya sat down at that place, he felt as if his monkhood had left him and as if he had assumed a king's appearance and were seated on a splendid couch, surrounded by beautiful dancers. And when, as a king, he was enjoying that splendor, a thought of sensuality arose in him. At that very time it happened that his great warriors brought to him two bandits whom they had arrested, and Meghiya saw them as distinctly as if they were standing in front of him. Now when (as a king) he was ordering the execution of one bandit, a thought of hate (aversion) arose in him; and when he was ordering the manacling and imprisonment, a thought of harming (aggressiveness) arose in him. So (even now, as Meghiya) he became entangled in these unwholesome thoughts like a tree in a net of creepers or like a honey-gatherer in a swarm of honey-bees."</dd>

<p>Once the Blessed One lived at Saavatthi, in the Jeta Grove, in Anaathapin.d.ika's monastery. At that time, the venerable Aananda approached the Blessed One and asked:</p>
<p>"What, Lord, is the benefit of good moral habits,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-1' id='fnt-10-1'>[1]</a> what is their reward?" &mdash; "Non-remorse, Aananda, is the benefit and reward of good moral habits."</p>
<p>"And what, Lord, is the benefit and reward of non-remorse?" &mdash; "Gladness, Aananda."</p>
<p>"And what, Lord, is the benefit and reward of gladness?" &mdash; "(Deep inner) joy (<i>piiti</i>)." "And what, Lord, is the benefit and reward of (deep inner) joy?" &mdash; "Tranquillity." "And what, Lord, is the benefit and reward of tranquillity?" &mdash; "Happiness." "And what, Lord, is the benefit and reward of happiness?" &mdash; "Concentration of the mind." "And what, Lord, is the benefit and reward of concentration?" &mdash; "Realistic knowledge and vision."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-2' id='fnt-10-2'>[2]</a></p>
<p>"And what, Lord, is the benefit and reward of realistic knowledge and vision?" &mdash; "Revulsion<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-3' id='fnt-10-3'>[3]</a> and dispassion."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-4' id='fnt-10-4'>[4]</a></p>

<p>For one who is happy, there is no need for an act of will: "May my mind be concentrated!"; it is natural for one who is happy that his mind will be concentrated.</p>
<p>For one who is concentrated, there is no need for an act of will: "May I know and see reality as it is!"; it is natural for a concentrated mind to know and see reality as it is.</p>
<p>For one who knows and sees reality as it is, there is no need for an act of will: "May I feel revulsion and dispassion (towards conditioned reality)!"; it is natural for one who knows and sees reality as it is, that he will feel revulsion and dispassion (towards it).</p>

<p>Thus, monks, revulsion and dispassion have knowledge and vision of deliverance as their benefit and reward... <i>(continued in conformity with the above, up to)</i>... thus good moral habits have non-remorse as their benefit and reward.</p>

<h3><a id='passage-20'>20. King Pasenadi's Homage to the Buddha</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-10'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Once, the Blessed One lived at Saavatthi, in the Jeta Grove, in Anaathapi.n.dika's monastery. At that time the Kosala king Pasenadi had returned from a sham battle,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-49' id='fnt-10-49'>[49]</a> having been victorious and having achieved his purpose. The king, then, set out in the direction of the monastery. As far as the cart road went, he rode by chariot; then he alighted from it and entered the monastery on foot.</p>
<p>At that time, a number of monks were walking up and down in the open. The king approached them and asked: "Where, your reverences, is the Blessed One staying now, the Holy One, fully enlightened?"</p>
<p>"He is staying in the lodging there, great king, where the door is shut. You may go there quietly and without haste. Then enter the veranda, clear your throat and knock with the door bar. The Blessed One will open the door for you."</p>
<p>The king did as he was told, entered the veranda, cleared his throat and knocked with the door bar. The Blessed One opened the door and the king went in. Bending low before the Blessed One, with his head on the ground, he kissed the Blessed One's feet, embracing them with his hands. Then he announced his name: "I am Pasenadi, Lord, the Kosala king. I am Pasenadi, Lord, the Kosala king."</p>
<p>"But, great king, what reason do you see for showing to this body such profound humility and offering it such loving devotion?"</p>
<p>"To express my grateful thanks, Lord; for that reason do I show to the Blessed One such profound humility and offer to him my loving devotion.</p>
<p>"For the Blessed One, Lord, lives for the welfare of many folk, for the happiness of many folk; because a great many people have been established by him in the holy method (of the Teaching), namely, in noble and beneficial principles. It is for this reason, Lord, that I show to the Blessed One such profound humility and offer him my loving devotion.</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One is virtuous, of virtue that is mature, of virtue that is holy, of virtue that is wholesome; he is endowed with wholesome virtue. It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One has been a forest dweller for a long time, he resorts to remote forest lands, to secluded dwellings. It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One is contented with whatever robes, alms food, dwelling, remedies and medicines he receives as requisites. It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, being the incomparable field of merit for the world. It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One obtains at will, without difficulty and trouble (the opportunity for) talk that is helpful to an austere life, useful for mental clarity; namely, talk on frugality, contentedness, solitude, seclusion, application of energy, virtue, concentration, wisdom, deliverance, and on the knowledge of wisdom and deliverance. It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One attains at will, without difficulty and trouble, the four jhaanas, which make for loftiness of mind and for a happy abiding in the present. It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One recollects his manifold past lives, that is to say, one birth... <i>(continue as in <a href="#passage-17-8">&sect;17(8)</a>)</i>... It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"Again, Lord, the Blessed One, with the divine eye, which is purified... <i>(continue as in <a href="#passage-17-9">&sect;17(9)</a>)</i>... It is for this reason...</p>
<p>"And again, Lord, the Blessed One, after destroying the cankers, has realized for himself here and now with direct knowledge the canker-free liberation of the heart and liberation by wisdom, and he enters upon and dwells in it. It is for this reason, Lord, that I show to the Blessed One such profound humility and offer him my loving devotion.</p>
<p>"But now, Lord, we must go. We have much work and many duties."</p>
<p>"Do as you think fit, great king."</p>
<p>And the Kosala king Pasenadi rose from his seat, saluted the Blessed One respectfully and keeping him to his right, departed.</p>

<h3><a id='passage-21'>21. Self-examination</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-10'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"If, monks, a monk is not skilled in (knowing) the ways of others' minds, he should resolve, 'I must become skilled in (knowing) the ways of my own mind.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-50' id='fnt-10-50'>[50]</a> Thus, monks, should you train yourselves.</p>
<p>"And how is a monk skilled in (knowing) the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a man or a woman, young, youthful and fond of adornment, would look at their face in a clean, bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they then see any dust or dirt, they will make all effort to remove it. But if no dust or dirt is seen, they will be glad about it, and their wish satisfied, they will think, 'How good! I am clean!'</p>
<p>"Similarly, monks, it is of great importance for a monk that he examines himself as to qualities in him that are wholesome: 'Am I often covetous or often not covetous? Do I often have ill-will in my heart or am I often free of it? Am I often immersed in sloth and torpor or am I often free of it? Am I excited or often free of excitement? Am I often in doubt or often free of doubt? Am I often angry or often free of anger? Is my mind often defiled (by unwholesome thoughts) or often free of defilements? Is my body often restless or often free of restlessness? Am I often lazy or often energetic? Am I often unconcentrated or often concentrated?'</p>
<p>"When a monk, in such self-examination, finds that he is often covetous, malevolent, slothful, excited, doubtful, angry, mentally defiled, bodily restless, lazy and unconcentrated, that monk should apply his utmost zeal and energy, effort and exertion, as well as unremitting mindfulness and clear comprehension, (directing them) to the abandoning of all those bad and unwholesome qualities.</p>
<p>"Just as a man whose clothes or turban are on fire will apply his utmost zeal and energy, effort and exertion, as well as mindfulness and clear comprehension, so that he may extinguish the fire; even so, for the abandoning of those bad and unwholesome qualities the monk should apply his utmost zeal and energy...</p>
<p>"But if that monk, on examining himself, finds that he is (more) often without covetousness and ill-will, (more) often free from sloth and torpor, from excitement and doubt; (more) often free from anger; and finds that his mind is (more) often undefiled and his body free of restlessness; that he is (more) often energetic and well concentrated &mdash; then grounding himself firmly in all these wholesome qualities, he should (go) beyond (that) and make an effort for the elimination of the cankers.</p>

<h3><a id='passage-28'>28. A Discriminative Teaching</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-10'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Once the Blessed One was staying near Campaa, on the bank of the Gaggaraa lotus pond.</p>
<p>One day the householder Vajjiyamaahita<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-71' id='fnt-10-71'>[71]</a> left Campaa at an early hour in order to see the Blessed One. Then he thought: "It is not the right time to visit the Blessed One, who will now be in seclusion. Nor is it the proper time to visit monks devoted to mind training; they, too, will be in seclusion. Let me now go to the park where the wandering ascetics of another persuasion stay."</p>
<p>When Vajjiyamaahita the householder arrived at the park, those wanderers of another persuasion were gathered there in company and, shouting and speaking loudly, they were sitting there engaged in diverse kinds of low talk. But when they saw Vajjiyamaahita the householder approaching from afar, they admonished each other to be quiet, saying: "Make less noise, your reverences, and be quiet! Here the householder Vajjiyamaahita is coming, a disciple of the recluse Gotama. He is one of the white-clad lay disciples of the recluse Gotama who stays now at Campaa. These worthy ones do not like much noise, they are used to being noiseless and they praise noiselessness. Perhaps if Vajjiyamaahita sees our group to be quiet, he may think of coming here."</p>
<p>These wandering ascetics now kept silent. When the householder Vajjiyamaahita had arrived there, he exchanged polite greetings and friendly talk with them and sat down at one side. When he was seated, the wanderers asked him:</p>
<p>"Is it true, householder, what they say &mdash; that the recluse Gotama blames all asceticism and that he unreservedly condemns and reproves all ascetics who live a harsh austere life?"</p>
<p>"No, venerable sirs, the Blessed One does not blame all asceticism, nor does he unreservedly condemn and reprove all ascetics living a harsh austere life. What is blameworthy, the Blessed One blames; what is praiseworthy, he praises. By blaming what is blameworthy and praising what is praiseworthy, the Blessed One teaches with discrimination, he does not teach here in a one-sided way."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-72' id='fnt-10-72'>[72]</a></p>
<p>At these words, a certain wanderer said this to the householder Vajjiyamaahita: "Wait a moment, householder! That recluse Gotama, whom you praise so much, is a nihilist,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-73' id='fnt-10-73'>[73]</a> and he is one who refrains from making (any definite) declarations."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-74' id='fnt-10-74'>[74]</a></p>
<p>"About that, too, venerable sir, I shall speak to your reverences according to Dhamma.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-75' id='fnt-10-75'>[75]</a> The Blessed One, venerable sir, declares that some things are wholesome and that some things are unwholesome. The Blessed One, having thus declared what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, is in fact one who makes (definite) declarations. He is not a nihilist, nor one who refrains from making (definite) declarations."</p>
<p>At these words, the wanderers kept silent in their embarrassment, sitting there with slumping shoulders and heads lowered, brooding and unable to utter a word. When Vajjiyamaahita saw them in that condition, he rose from his seat and left to see the Blessed One. Having arrived, after saluting the Master, he told him of his conversation with these wanderers of another persuasion. And the Blessed One said:</p>
<p>"Well done, householder, well done! In that way, householder, should such foolish persons, when occasion offers, be well refuted by you according to Dhamma.</p>
<p>"I do not say, householder, that all asceticism should be practiced; nor do I say of all asceticism that it should not be practiced. I do not say that all observances should be performed; nor do I say of all observances that they should not be performed. I do not say that every (spiritual) effort should be done or every act of renunciation carried out; nor do I say of every (spiritual) effort that it should not be done; nor of every act of renunciation that it should not be carried out. I do not say that one should free oneself by every kind of freedom; nor do I say of every kind of freedom that one should not free oneself by it.</p>
<p>"What I declare, householder, is that such an asceticism should not be practiced which makes unwholesome states grow and wholesome states wane. But an asceticism which makes unwholesome states wane and wholesome states grow, such asceticism, I declare, should be practiced.</p>
<p>"If in performing observances, making spiritual efforts, carrying out acts of renunciation, freeing oneself by certain kinds of freedom,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-76' id='fnt-10-76'>[76]</a> unwholesome states wane and wholesome states grow, then all these practices should be undertaken, I declare."</p>
<p>Then Vajjiyamaahita the householder, thus instructed by the Blessed One's Dhamma talk, roused by it, inspired and gladdened, rose from his seat, saluted the Blessed One respectfully, and keeping him to his right, departed.</p>
<p>"Monks, even a monk who has had for a long time clear vision<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-77' id='fnt-10-77'>[77]</a> as to this Teaching and Discipline would well refute those wanderers of another persuasion in the very same way the householder Vajjiyamaahita has done."</p>

<h3><a id='passage-29'>29. Will All Beings Attain Liberation?</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-10'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Once a wandering ascetic named Uttiya approached the Blessed One. After an exchange of courteous and polite words, he sat down at one side and asked:</p>
<p>"How is it, revered Gotama: is the world eternal &mdash; is only this true and everything else nonsensical?"</p>
<p>"This, Uttiya, I have not declared: that the world is eternal; and that only this is true and everything else is nonsensical."</p>
<p>"How then, revered Gotama: is the world non-eternal &mdash; is only this true and everything else nonsensical?"</p>
<p>"That, too, Uttiya, I have not declared: that the world is non-eternal; and that only this is true and everything else nonsensical."</p>
<p>"How is it, revered Gotama: is the world infinite or finite? Are the life principle and the body the same or different? Does the Tathaagata exist after death or does he not exist after death? Does he exist as well as not exist or neither exist nor not exist after death? Is (any one of these statements) the only one that is true and everything else nonsensical?"</p>
<p>"All that, Uttiya, I have not declared: that the world is finite... that the Tathaagata neither exists nor does not exist after death; (nor did I declare) that (any one of these statements) is the only true one and that everything else is nonsensical."</p>
<p>"But how is it, revered Gotama? To all my questions you have replied that you have not so declared. What, after all, does the revered Gotama actually declare?"</p>
<p>"Having directly known it, Uttiya, I have taught the Dhamma to my disciples for the purification of beings, for getting beyond sorrow and lamentation, for the ending of pain and grief, for attaining to the method (of liberation) and for realising Nibbaana."</p>
<p>"But if the revered Gotama, out of his direct knowledge, teaches Dhamma to his disciples for the purification of beings, for getting beyond sorrow and lamentation, for the ending of pain and grief, for attaining to the method (of liberation) and for realising Nibbaana, will the whole world thereby escape (from sa.msaara),<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-78' id='fnt-10-78'>[78]</a> or half of it or a third part of it?"</p>
<p>At these words, the Blessed One kept silent.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-79' id='fnt-10-79'>[79]</a></p>
<p>Then this thought occurred to the venerable Aananda: "May Uttiya the wanderer not conceive a harmful opinion, by thinking, 'When the recluse Gotama was asked by me an all-important question,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-80' id='fnt-10-80'>[80]</a> he foundered and did not reply. Probably he could not.' But such a view would bring harm and suffering to Uttiya for a long time."</p>
<p>Hence the venerable Aananda turned to Uttiya, saying:</p>
<p>"I shall give you a simile, friend Uttiya, for with the help of a simile intelligent people may come to understand the meaning of what was said.</p>
<p>"Suppose, friend Uttiya, there is a king's border town, with strong ramparts and turrets on sound foundations, and with a single gate. There is also a gate-keeper, intelligent, experienced and prudent, who keeps out people unknown and admits only those who are known. That gatekeeper walks along the path that girdles the town all round, and while doing so he does not notice in the ramparts any hole or opening, not even one big enough for a cat to slip through. Though he does not have the knowledge of how many creatures enter the town or leave it, yet he does know this: 'Any larger creatures that enter or leave this town can do so only by this gate.'</p>
<p>"Similarly, friend Uttiya, the Tathaagata is not concerned (with your question) whether the entire world will escape (from sa.msaara) by that (teaching of his) or half of it or a third part. But the Tathaagata is aware that whosoever has escaped, does now escape and will escape from the world, all these will do so by removing the five hindrances that defile the mind and weaken understanding, by firmly establishing their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness, and by cultivating the seven factors of enlightenment in their true nature. That same question, friend Uttiya, which you had asked the Blessed One before, you have asked him again in another way."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-81' id='fnt-10-81'>[81]</a></p>

<h3><a id='passage-32'>32. The Extinction of Kamma</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#book-10'>&nbsp;</a></h3>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"I declare, monks, that actions (kamma) willed, performed and accumulated, will not become extinct as long as their results have not been experienced, be it in this life, in the next life or in future lives. And as long as these results of actions willed, performed and accumulated, have not been experienced, there will be no end to suffering, I declare.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-86' id='fnt-10-86'>[86]</a></p>
<p>"There are, monks, tainted failures (in living)<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-87' id='fnt-10-87'>[87]</a> caused by unwholesome volition, which are productive of suffering, resulting in suffering. These tainted failures are threefold in bodily acts, fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts.</p>
<p>"How are these tainted failures (in living) caused by unwholesome volition... threefold in bodily acts?</p>
<p>"There is a person who takes the life of living beings; he is cruel and his hands are blood-stained; he is bent on slaying and murdering, having no compassion for any living being.</p>
<p>"He takes what is not given to him, appropriates with thievish intention the property of others in village and forest.</p>
<p>"He conducts himself wrongly in matters of sex: he has intercourse with those under the protection of father, mother, brother, sister, relatives or clan, or of their religious community<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-88' id='fnt-10-88'>[88]</a>; or with those promised to a husband,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-89' id='fnt-10-89'>[89]</a> publicly betrothed,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-90' id='fnt-10-90'>[90]</a> and lastly those betrothed with a garland.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-91' id='fnt-10-91'>[91]</a></p>
<p>"In this way, tainted failure (in living)... is threefold in bodily acts.</p>
<p>"And how is tainted failure (in living)... fourfold in verbal acts?</p>
<p>"There is one who is a liar. When he is in the council of his community or in another assembly, or among his relatives, his guild, before the royal family, or has been summoned as a witness and is asked to tell what he knows, then, though he does not know, he will say 'I know'; though he does know, he will say 'I do not know'; though not having seen, he will say 'I have seen'; and though having seen, he will say 'I have not seen.' In that way he utters deliberate lies, be it for his own sake, for the sake of others, or for some material advantage.</p>
<p>"He is a tale-bearer: what he hears here, he reports elsewhere, for causing friction there; and what he hears elsewhere, he reports here, for causing friction here. Thus he creates discord among those united, and he incites still more those who are in discord. He is fond of dissension, he delights and rejoices in it, and he utters words that cause dissension.</p>
<p>"He speaks harshly, using speech that is coarse, rough, bitter and abusive, that makes others angry and causes distraction of mind. It is such speech that he utters.</p>
<p>"He indulges in vain talk: he speaks what is untimely, unreasonable and unprofitable, having no connection with Dhamma or Discipline. His talk is not worth treasuring, it is inopportune, inadvisable, unrestrained and harmful.</p>
<p>"In this way, tainted failure (in living)... is fourfold in verbal acts.</p>
<p>"And how is tainted failure (in living)... threefold in mental acts?</p>
<p>"There is a person who is covetous; he covets the wealth and property of others, thinking: 'Oh, that what he owns might belong to me!'</p>
<p>"There is also one who has ill-will in his heart. He has depraved thoughts, such as these: 'Let these beings be slain! Let them be killed and destroyed! May they perish and cease to exist!'</p>
<p>"He has wrong views and perverted ideas, such as these: 'There is no (moral value in a) gift, offering or sacrifice; there is no fruit or recompense from deeds good or evil; there is neither this world nor another world<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-92' id='fnt-10-92'>[92]</a>; there are no (duties towards) mother and father; there are no spontaneously mind-born beings; and there are no recluses and brahmans in this world, living and conducting themselves rightly, who can explain this world and the world beyond, having realized them by their own direct knowledge.'</p>
<p>"In this way, tainted failure (in living), which is caused by unwholesome volition and is productive of suffering, resulting in suffering, is threefold in mental acts.</p>
<p>"As to that tainted failure (in living), which is threefold in bodily acts, fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts, and which, having been caused by unwholesome volition, produces suffering, results in suffering, it is due to those very failures (in living) that beings, after death, when the body breaks up, are reborn in a world of woe, in an unhappy destiny, a state of misery, in the hells.</p>
<p>"Just as a perfect throw of dice, when thrown upwards, will come to rest firmly wherever it falls, similarly beings will be reborn in states of woe... due to those tainted failures (in living) caused by unwholesome volition.</p>
<p>"I declare, monks, that actions (kamma) willed, performed and accumulated, will not become extinct as long as their results have not been experienced, be it in this life, in the next life or in future lives. And as long as these results of actions willed, performed and accumulated, have not been experienced, there will be no end to suffering, I declare.</p>
<p>"There are, monks, successes<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10-93' id='fnt-10-93'>[93]</a> (in living) caused by wholesome volition which are productive of happiness, resulting in happiness. They are threefold in bodily acts, fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts.</p>
<p>"How are these successes (in living) caused by wholesome volition... threefold in bodily acts?</p>
<p>"There is a person who abstains from taking the life of living beings; he has put away cudgels and weapons; he has a moral conscience and is compassionate; full of sympathy for all living beings, he wishes for their welfare.</p>
<p>"He gives up sexual misconduct and abstains from it. He does not have intercourse with those under the protection of father, mother... nor, lastly, with those betrothed with a garland.</p>
<p>"In this way, success (in living)... is threefold in bodily acts.</p>
<p>"And how is success (in living)... fourfold in verbal acts?</p>
<p>"There is a person who has given up lying and abstains from it. When he is in the council of his community or in another assembly, or among his relatives, his guild, before the royal family, or has been summoned as a witness and is asked to tell what he knows, then, when knowing, he will say 'I know'; and when not knowing, he will say 'I do not know'; and when he has seen, he will say 'I have seen'; and when he has not seen, he will say 'I have not seen.' He will not utter any deliberate lie, be it for his own sake, for the sake of others, or for some material advantage.</p>
<p>"He has given up tale-bearing and abstains from it. What he has heard here, he will not report elsewhere, for causing friction there; and what he has heard elsewhere, he will not report here, for causing friction here. In that way he unites those who are divided, and encourages those who are in harmony. Concord gladdens him, he delights and rejoices in concord, and he utters words that foster concord.</p>
<p>"He has given up harsh speech and abstains from it. His words are gentle, pleasant to hear, endearing, heart-warming, courteous, agreeable to many folk, pleasing to many folk.</p>
<p>"He has given up vain talk and abstains from it. He speaks timely, in accordance with facts and profitably. He speaks of Dhamma and Discipline and talks in a way that is worth treasuring. His talk is opportune, helpful, moderate and meaningful.</p>
<p>"In this way, success (in living) is fourfold... in verbal acts.</p>
<p>"And how is success (in living)... threefold in mental acts?</p>
<p>"Herein a person is free from covetousness; he does not covet the wealth and property of others, thinking: 'Oh, that what he owns might belong to me!'</p>
<p>"He has no ill-will in his heart. He has pure thoughts and intentions, such as these: 'May these beings be free from enmity, free from anxiety! May they be untroubled and live happily!'</p>
<p>"He has right views and correct ideas, such as these: 'There is (moral value in) gifts, offerings and sacrifice; there is fruit and recompense from deeds good or evil; there is both this world and another world; there are (duties towards) mother and father, there exist spontaneously mind-born beings; and there exist in this world recluses and brahmans, living and conducting themselves rightly, who can explain this world and the world beyond, having realized them by their own direct knowledge.'</p>
<p>"In this way, success (in living), which is caused by wholesome volition... is threefold in mental acts.</p>
<p>"As to that success (in living), which is threefold in bodily acts, fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts, and having been caused by wholesome volition, produces happiness, results in happiness, it is due to that very success (in living) that beings after death, on the break-up of the body, are reborn to a happy destiny, in a heavenly world.</p>
<p>"Just as a perfect throw of dice, when thrown upwards, will come to rest firmly wherever it falls, similarly beings will be reborn to a happy destiny, in a heavenly world, due to success (in living), caused by wholesome volition.</p>
<p>"I declare, monks, that actions (kamma) willed, performed and accumulated, will not become extinct as long as their results have not been experienced, be it in this life, in the next life or in future lives.

The venerable Anuruddha, one of the great disciples (<i>mahaa-saavaka</i>), claimed, however, to have attained to these ten powers by his frequent cultivation of Satipa.t.thaana (see SN 52.5 ff.). But the Commentary to that text says that disciples have them only partly (<i>ekadesena</i>), while Tathaagatas, and only they, have them completely (<i>nippadesena</i>), and with them they are perfect in every respect. The ten Tathaagata powers also occur at <a href="../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.012.ntbb.html">MN 12</a>, and are treated in detail in the Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pi.taka (~Na.na-Vibhanga) and its commentary.</dd>

The first, that is, the knowledge of penetration, is produced by <i>wisdom</i> and led the Tathaagata to his own attainment of noble fruition (<i>ariyaphala</i>). The other, the knowledge of teaching, is produced by <i>compassion</i> and enables the Tathaagata to lead his disciples to the attainment of noble fruition. Of these two kinds of knowledge, the former is supramundane (<i>lokuttara</i>) while the other is mundane (<i>lokiya</i>). Both kinds of knowledge, however, are not held in common with others; they are the Enlightened One's very own kind of knowledge."</dd>

In the Vibhanga, as examples for cause and non-cause, the possibilities and impossibilities mentioned in the Anguttara Nikaaya, Book of the Ones, are given, a few of which are translated in Part I of this Anthology (Wheel No. 155/158), pp. 4ff.</dd>

There are some evil actions performed, which, because of unfavorable rebirth... unfavorable body... unfavorable time... unfavorable effort... do mature.'"

	<dd><i>No c'assa.m no ca me siyaa; na bhavissaami, na me bhavissati.</i> Bracketed additions in the translation are derived from the Commentary. This terse, cryptic, mantra-like saying of non-Buddhist origin occurs often in the suttas and partly in an extended form. In most occurrences, the second part reads <i>na bhavissati, na me bhavissati,</i> which would give the following meaning: "If there will be no (rebirth-producing kamma), there will be for me no (further existence)." In connection with our present text, however, the Commentary expressly refers to a reading <i>na bhavissaami</i> (first person) and explains it as bracketed in this translation.
	<p>If the view expressed in the saying under consideration is wrongly conceived, it will lead to an annihilationist view (<i>uccheda-di.t.thi</i>), as exemplified in <a href="../../../tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.081.than.html">SN 22.81</a>. This same formula, however, is also mentioned approvingly by the Buddha. In <a href="../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.106.than.html">MN 106</a> it occurs as one of the reflections of a noble disciple (<i>ariya-saavaka</i>), which, on the <i>samatha</i> road, may lead him to the sphere of nothingness; or, if he turns to <i>vipassanaa,</i> to insight-wisdom. In <a href="../../../tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.055.than.html">SN 22.55</a>, the Buddha says that, if a monk is firmly resolved (in the way expressed by that formula), he might cut off the lower fetters (i.e., reach the stage of non-return). In AN 7.52, the formula is mentioned in connection with the five types of non-returner.</p></dd>

<p>"If, monks, the liberation of the heart by loving-kindness is cultivated, developed, frequently practiced, made one's vehicle and foundation, firmly established, consolidated, and properly perfected, eleven blessings can be expected. What are the eleven?</p>
<p>"One sleeps peacefully; one has no evil dreams; one is dear to human beings; one is dear to non-human beings; one will be protected by deities; fire, poison and weapons cannot hurt one; one's mind becomes easily concentrated; the features of one's face will be serene; one will die unconfused; and if one does not penetrate higher, one will be reborn in the Brahma-world."</p>
