<p>This index lists the summaries of the training rules given in this book, organized by topic. The Sekhiya rules have not been included, because they are short, deal almost exclusively with etiquette, and are already organized by topic in their own chapter. I have included short summaries of the adhikara&#7751;a-samatha rules, even though these summaries do not appear in the chapter discussing those rules.</p>

<p>The rules are divided into five major categories, dealing with Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Communal harmony, and the etiquette of a contemplative. The first three categories &#8212; the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path that make up the training in heightened virtue &#8212; show in particular how the training rules relate to the Buddhist path as a whole.</p>

<p>These five categories are not sharply distinct types. Instead, they are more like the colors in the band of light thrown off by a prism &#8212; discernably different, but shading into one another with no sharp dividing lines. Right Speech, for instance, often shades into Communal harmony, just as Right Livelihood shades into personal etiquette. Thus the placement of a particular rule in one category rather than another is occasionally somewhat arbitrary. There are a few cases &#8212; such as <a href="bmc1.ch08-5.html#Pc46">Pc 46</a> &amp; <a href="bmc1.ch08-9.html#Pc85">85</a> &#8212; where the reason for the placement of the rule will become clear only after a reading of the detailed discussion of the rule in the text.</p>


<h2>Right Speech</h2>

<p><a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.117.than.html">MN 117</a> defines <i>wrong speech</i> as lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, and idle chatter.</p>

<h4>Lying</h4>

<p>Making an unfounded charge to a bhikkhu that he has committed a p&#257;r&#257;jika offense, in hopes of having him disrobed, is a sa&#7749;gh&#257;disesa offense. (<a href="bmc1.ch05.html#Sg8">Sg 8</a>)</p>


<p>Distorting the evidence while accusing a bhikkhu of having committed a p&#257;r&#257;jika offense, in hopes of having him disrobed, is a sa&#7749;gh&#257;disesa offense. (<a href="bmc1.ch05.html#Sg9">Sg 9</a>)</p>

<p>An insult made with malicious intent to another bhikkhu is a p&#257;cittiya offense. (<a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc2">Pc 2</a>)</p>


<h4>Idle chatter</h4>

<p>Visiting lay families &#8212; without having informed an available bhikkhu &#8212; before or after a meal to which one has been invited is a p&#257;cittiya offense except during the robe season or any time one is making a robe. (<a href="bmc1.ch08-5.html#Pc46">Pc 46</a>)</p>


<p>Entering a village, town, or city during the period after noon until the following dawn, without having taken leave of an available bhikkhu &#8212; unless there is an emergency &#8212; is a p&#257;cittiya offense. (<a href="bmc1.ch08-9.html#Pc85">Pc 85</a>)</p>

<p>Using water, or getting others to use it, knowing that it contains living beings that will die from that use, is a p&#257;cittiya offense. (<a href="bmc1.ch08-7.html#Pc62">Pc 62</a>)</p>


<h4>Taking what is not given</h4>
