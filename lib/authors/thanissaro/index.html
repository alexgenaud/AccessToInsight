<span class='by'>by  Thanissaro Bhikkhu</span>
<span class='filedata'>(1997; 5pp./14KB)</span>
  </dt>
<dd>Popular interpretations of Buddhism today often ignore the importance of two powerful emotions, emotions that propelled the Buddha &mdash; and all those who have sought Awakening since &mdash; towards the goal of Awakening: <i>samvega,</i> a sense of urgency to escape the round of meaningless existence; and <i>pasada,</i> a clarity and serene confidence that allows one to proceed confidently towards the goal without lapsing into despair. In this short essay the author explores the meaning of these essential emotions and how we can encourage them to blossom in our lives. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./noblestrategy.html'>Noble Strategy</a></i>.</p></dd>

  </dt>
<dd>Mindfulness meditation is sometimes described as a kind of "passive all-encompassing acceptance" of one's immediate experience. But, as the author reminds us in this essay, the Pali texts paint a very different picture of what meditation is all about: it is, in fact, a very pro-active process with a clear agenda. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#karmaquestions'>The Karma of Questions</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>What did the Buddha really have to say about <i>anicca</i> &mdash; inconstancy and change? Does the fact of impermanence tell us (as some popular teachings claim) that we should learn to "embrace our experiences without clinging," that we have the freedom to "create whatever world we want to live in"? In fact, the Buddha's teachings on anicca offer something far more useful and profound. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#purityofheartbook'>Purity of Heart</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>The 227 Patimokkha training rules, which are recorded in the Suttavibhanga (the first major section of the <a href='./../../../tipitaka/vin/index.html'>Vinaya Pitaka</a>), affect every aspect of the daily life of the Theravada Buddhist bhikkhu (monk). The Patimokkha rules are presented here along with summaries of their "origin stories" and extensive commentary to help the monk-in-training master the fine points of monastic conduct. This book is now in widespread use at English-speaking Theravada monasteries around the world. This is the third edition, revised in 2013 (PDF only).

  </dt>
<dd>Accordingly to one popular theory, the Buddha's teachings have survived all these years thanks to their ability to adapt to the customs of whatever culture they find themselves at each moment in history. The case of the Thai forest <i>kammatthana</i> tradition, however, offers a striking counterexample to this notion. As the author argues in this essay, history has shown that the true Dhamma survives only when people have been willing to adapt their own customs and habits so as to meet the Dhamma face-to-face, on its own terms. </dd>

<dd>When we sit down to meditate we usually bring along a host of assumptions about what our perceptions are, what our experience of meditation is like, and what it should be. As meditators, our task is to learn to ask the right questions &mdash; questions that will help us break through layer after layer of these false preconceived notions. This article, based on a Dhamma talk, is full of practical advice for meditators of all levels. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#karmaquestions'>The Karma of Questions</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>The Dhammapada, an anthology of verses attributed to the Buddha, has long been recognized as one of the masterpieces of early Buddhist literature. Only more recently have scholars realized that it is also one of the early masterpieces in the Indian tradition of <i>kavya,</i> or belles lettres. This translation of the Dhammapada is an attempt to render the verses into English in a way that does justice to both of the traditions to which the text belongs. This translation also grew from the translator's conviction that the text deserved to be offered freely as a gift of Dhamma. As few good-quality translations of this beloved text are currently available as gifts, the translator was inspired to make his own. Thus was this translation born. </dd>

  </dt>
<dd>When asked, "What am I?" Buddhist scholars and meditation teachers, alike, usually state that what we conventionally call a "person" is best understood in terms of the five <i>khandhas:</i> form, feeling, perceptions, mental fabrications, and consciousness. This understanding of the khandhas, which first emerged several centuries after the Buddha's death in the commentarial literature, differs significantly from the role of the khandhas as presented in the Pali canon. In this essay the author shows that the Buddha used the teachings of the khandhas not to define what we are, but rather as a tool to help us put an end to our suffering. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#karmaquestions'>The Karma of Questions</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>Human beings have forever lived in fear: fear of change, of loss, of death. Unfortunately, we have also adopted a host of unskillful ways to deal with those fears. The author writes: "The most unskillful response to fear is when, perceiving dangers to our own life or property, we believe that we can gain strength and security by destroying the lives and property of others." In this essay the author describes the Buddha's prescription for overcoming fear once and for all, by uprooting its very cause. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#karmaquestions'>The Karma of Questions</a></i></p></dd>

<dd>Much has been written about the Buddhist concept of emptiness &mdash; in particular, that it refers to a metaphysical principle of the absence of any inherent existence. In this essay the author points out that this notion has very little to do with what the Buddha himself actually said about emptiness. In fact, the Buddha's teachings on emptiness are of a fundamentally practical nature, having everything to do with how to choose your actions with care and how to relate to their results with wisdom. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#purityofheartbook'>Purity of Heart</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>Early Buddhism borrowed two of its central terms from the workings of fire. <i>Upadana,</i> or clinging, originally referred to the fuel that kept fire burning; <i>nibbana,</i> the name of the goal, to a fire's going out. This is the first book to examine these terms from the perspective of how the early Buddhists themselves viewed fire &mdash; what they saw happening as a fire burned, and what happened to the fire when it went out &mdash; to show what light this perspective throws on Buddhist doctrine in general, and the practice of meditation in particular. With extensive quotations from the Pali canon, newly translated, this is also a useful sourcebook for anyone who wants to encounter Buddhist teachings in their earliest known context. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> To request a printed copy of this book, please write to: <a href='likefire/../../../../sources.html#metta'>Metta Forest Monastery</a>, P.O.

<dd>The Buddha's second Noble Truth states that the cause of suffering is any kind of craving that stimulates becoming (bhava; the process by which we continually fabricate new states of mind, from moment to moment and lifetime to lifetime). Yet this Noble Truth also states that the desire for non-becoming is one of the three basic forms of craving. Thus the paradox: How can we attain the end of suffering if the desire to end it is itself a cause of suffering? In this book the author explores the Buddha's own resolution of this paradox: how, through the practice of jh&#257;na, we can create a unique state of becoming whereby the mind does not add further fuel to its desires. Eventually, this intentionally fabricated state of becoming itself comes to an end, providing the long-sought opening to the Deathless.  [Not available in HTML] </dd>

<dd><i>Appamadena sampadetha!</i> &mdash; such was the dying Buddha's parting instruction, which has often been translated as "Practice diligently!" But a wider reading in the suttas reveals that that crucial word <i>appamada</i> has a far more nuanced and significant meaning. According to the author, the Buddha's real message was, "Don't be complacent. Watch out for danger. Protect the mind's good qualities. Don't let your guard down." <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#purityofheartbook'>Purity of Heart</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>One popular misconception of Buddhism maintains that the Buddha's teachings basically boil down to ridding ourselves of desire. In this essay the author reminds us that the path to liberation is, in fact, firmly rooted in desire&mdash;in <i>skillful</i> desire.

The material is divided into three parts: (I) an introductory essay on the meaning of refuge and the act of going for refuge; (II) a series of readings drawn from the earliest Buddhist texts illustrating the essential qualities of the Triple Gem; and (III) a set of essays explaining aspects of the Triple Gem that often provoke questions in those who are new to the Buddha's teachings. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> To request a printed copy of this book, please write to: <a href='./../../../sources.html#metta'>Metta Forest Monastery</a>, P.O.

<dd>Sometimes it is difficult to appreciate the extent to which one's attitudes towards meditation practice can be influenced by modern cultural trends. In this short excursion into Western cultural history, the author explores the origins of such familar notions as interconnectedness, oneness, and ego-transcendence&mdash;ideas popularly attributed to the Buddha&mdash;and finds that their roots lie instead in the 18<span style='vertical-align:super;font-size:60%'>th</span> and 19<span style='vertical-align:super;font-size:60%'>th</span> century movements of Romanticism and Transcendentalism. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./index.html#purityofheartbook'>Purity of Heart</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>According to the basic principle of karma, our underlying intentions play a crucial role in determining the ultimate fruits of our actions. As the author explains in this essay, if we're genuinely interested in pursuing the goal of the Buddha's teachings, it's not enough that we act merely with <i>good</i> intentions; rather, we must learn, through honest self-reflection and association with virtuous and wise friends, to cultivate <i>skillfulness</i> in our intentions. <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> A printed copy is included in the book <i><a href='./noblestrategy.html'>Noble Strategy</a></i>.</p></dd>

<dd>For centuries scholars have argued over which parts of the Pali canon &mdash; if any &mdash; contain an accurate record of the Buddha's teachings. The texts themselves state that doubts about the Dhamma can be decisively resolved only if one puts the teachings into practice to the point of attaining stream-entry, the first stage of enlightenment.

<dd><p>The "Wings to Awakening" <i>(bodhipakkhiya-dhamma)</i> is the Buddha's own list of his most important teachings. It includes teachings on the Four Frames of Reference, the Four Right Exertions, the Four Bases of Power, the Five Faculties, the Five Strengths, the Seven Factors for Awakening, and the Noble Eightfold Path. Toward the end of his life, the Buddha stated several times that as long as the teachings in this list were remembered and put into practice, his message would endure. The Buddha himself described the Wings to Awakening as being what was most worth mastering and passing along to others.</p>
	<p>The material gathered in this anthology consists of more than 200 newly translated passages from the suttas, along with extensive commentary to help the reader grasp their full meaning and their relation to the practice of meditation. This volume is thus both a treasure-house of important passages from the Canon covering the key points of the Buddha's teachings, as well as a practical manual to help the serious meditation student navigate through some of the most fundamental and profound points of Dhamma.</p> <p class='availability'><img src='./../../../img/book.gif' alt='[book icon]'     /> To request a printed copy of this book, please write to: <a href='./wings/../../../../sources.html#metta'>Metta Forest Monastery</a>, P.O.
