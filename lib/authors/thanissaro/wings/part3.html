<h1><a id='part3-a'>A. Conviction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>As we noted in the Introduction, all of the 37 factors listed in the Wings to Awakening can be subsumed under the five faculties. Whereas <a href="part2.html#part2-a">Part II</a> focused on the interrelationships among these various factors, this part of the book is devoted to using the five faculties as a framework for discussing the individual factors in and of themselves.</p>

<p>Of the five faculties, the faculty of conviction covers the most ground, as it includes the total context for the practice of the Buddha's teachings. The many issues related to the attitudes and ethics needed to lead a Buddhist life, whether as a lay person or a monastic, fall under this category.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part2.html#passage-69'>&sect;69</a> defines the faculty of conviction as the <a id='sotapanna-3a'>four factors</a> of stream-entry [<a href="part2.html#sotapanna2-2a">II/A</a>], so to understand the nature of conviction, it is necessary to know what these four factors are. Passages <a href='part2.html#passage-70'>&sect;70</a> and <a href='part2.html#passage-71'>&sect;71</a> give different definitions for the four. The first list gives prerequisites for stream-entry: association with good people, listening to the true Dhamma, appropriate attention, and practice in accordance with the Dhamma. The second list gives <a id='sotapanna3-3a'>qualities</a> that characterize a person who has entered the stream: <a id='convict-3a'>verified confidence</a> in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha; and virtues appealing to the noble ones. Both lists are relevant here, for conviction is a quality that leads to stream-entry, whereas the attainment of stream-entry is the point where conviction becomes unshakable. Only on the <a id='arahant1-3a'>attainment of Arahantship</a> does knowledge become so total that conviction is no longer needed [<a href='part2.html#passage-89'>&sect;89</a>].</p>

<p>The two lists of the factors of stream-entry are similar in that they both cover all three aspects of conviction: social (whom to trust), intellectual (what to believe), and practical (how to act as a result). Because conviction is focused not on a descriptive proposition but on a course of action &mdash; the skillful mastery of the processes of kamma in a social context &mdash; these aspects are inextricably intertwined. The social aspect comes from the need to associate with people who have already mastered these processes, learning from their words and emulating their actions. The intellectual aspect &mdash; belief in the principle of kamma &mdash; is necessary because the development of skillfulness within the mind requires that one understand the nature of kamma, take responsibility for one's actions, and have conviction in one's ability to benefit from developing one's skills. The practical aspect is necessary, for if one does not follow through in developing skill, it shows that one's conviction in the development of skillfulness is not genuine, and that one is not fully benefiting from one's beliefs.</p>

<p>The relationship of these factors to the development of skillfulness is shown in several passages. For instance, <a href='part2.html#passage-53'>&sect;53</a> and <a href='part2.html#passage-54'>&sect;54</a> cite association with good people and appropriate attention &mdash; both of which are members of the first list above &mdash; as the primary external and internal prerequisites for the development of what is skillful. At the same time, the intellectual and practical aspects of conviction help to counteract the grosser levels of the roots of unskillfulness [<a href='part1.html#passage-3'>&sect;3</a>]: belief in the principle of kamma helps to undercut delusion, while the practice of virtue helps to weaken the force of greed and aversion in the mind.</p>

<p>To understand the detailed interaction of the social, intellectual, and practical aspects of conviction, we first have to examine them separately. Because <a id='mitta-3a'>having admirable people as friends</a> is the whole of the holy life [<a href='part3.html#passage-115'>&sect;115</a>], we will begin with the <b>social aspect</b> first.</p>

<p>The passages in this section focusing on the social aspect of conviction touch on two major issues: how to recognize good people, and why one should associate with them.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-119'>&sect;119</a> lists three basic teachings of good people. These can be taken as criteria for judging whether a person qualifies as good. If one meets people who criticize the practice of <a id='dana-3a'>generosity</a>, the practice of going forth into the renunciate life, or the practice of giving service to one's parents, one would do well to avoid associating with them, for their wisdom and motives cannot be trusted. If one must associate with them, one should not regard them as people to learn from or to emulate. Thus the social and intellectual aspects of conviction interact in that one way of knowing whether to associate with a person is by listening to what that person teaches; at the same time, the teachings of good people enable one to know what is good.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-117'>&sect;117</a> carries this point further, listing positive qualities to look for in a good person: conviction in the principle of kamma, generosity, virtue, and discernment. People who teach these qualities and embody them in their lives qualify as good. The important point here, of course, is that good people are ultimately recognized by what they habitually do, rather than simply by what they say. These habits can be known only through long association over time. This is why, in the Buddhist monkhood, a student does not take a lifetime vow of obedience to a teacher. If he feels that the teacher does not have his best interests at heart &mdash; i.e., if he sees that the teacher does not really embody the above qualities &mdash; he is free to leave the teacher in search of another.</p>

<p><a id='sotapanna4-3a'>A person who has attained stream-entry</a> finds it easier to recognize good people, for he/she is now a member of the noble Sangha and can recognize the qualities of that attainment in others as well. "Good people" for a member of the Sangha means the Buddha and the rest of the noble Sangha. Of course the Buddha has long been totally unbound, but he left his <a id='dv-3a'>Dhamma and Vinaya</a> as a teacher in his stead [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/dn/dn.16.5-6.than.html">DN 16</a>], and so on that level one may still associate with him.</p>

<p>The reason why a person embarking on the path to practice would need to <a id='mitta2-3a'>associate with good people</a>, rather than trying to be totally self-reliant, is that the roots of skillfulness within the mind lie mixed with the roots of unskillfulness, and the roots of unskillfulness make it difficult to tell which is which. Thus one needs the advice and example of others more experienced on the path to help identify one's own skillful qualities and to give encouragement in the task of developing them [<a href='part1.html#passage-9'>&sect;9</a>]. Even if one is not yet committed to following the path, one would be wise to associate with good people who embody conviction, generosity, virtue, and discernment, for they are unlikely to treat one in an unfair or harmful manner. If they truly embody conviction and virtue, one can trust that their sense of shame and compunction will prevent them from acting on unskillful intentions. If they truly embody generosity and discernment, they have wisdom worth acquiring and will be willing to share it. This sharing of wisdom forms the basis for further benefits &mdash; as listed in <a href='part3.html#passage-125'>&sect;125</a> &amp; <a href='part3.html#passage-126'>&sect;126</a> &mdash; setting in motion a causal chain leading all the way to the experience of Awakening. This causal chain requires that one listen to the teachings of good people so as to understand the implications of the principle of kamma. It also requires that one take such people as examples to emulate in one's own life. In this way, one can become a better person oneself and can enjoy the benefits coming with one's own improved mastery over the principle of kamma.</p>

<p>The wide availability of books on Buddhism tends to obscure the fact that the truths of the Buddha's teachings are not simply words or propositions, but are qualities of the heart and mind: the skillful mastery of thoughts, words, and deeds. These qualities are best learned not from books but from people who are actually skilled. This is like learning a sport. One can pick up important principles from books written about the sport, but there is much more on a non-verbal level that can be learned only by associating with people who have actually mastered the sport. This might include a sense of how much practice is enough, a sense of one's own strengths and weaknesses, a sense of timing, a sense of one's teammates and opponents, and so forth. <a href="../../../../tipitaka/an/an07/an07.064.than.html">AN 7.64</a> gives a similar list of the principles that characterize a good person, many of which cannot be verbalized in simple rules: knowledge of the Dhamma, knowledge of the meaning of statements, a sense of one's own strengths and weaknesses, a sense of moderation in the use of the requisites of life, a sense of the proper time and season for doing things, a sense of different levels of societies, and a sense of how to judge people. Although the first two types of knowledge in this list are verbal and can be passed on in words, the others are more subliminal and can be picked up only by associating with good people and watching them in action.</p>

<p>With the issue of verbal knowledge we move from the social aspect of conviction to its <b>intellectual aspect.</b> The content of the verbal knowledge that can be picked up from good people begins with what <a href='part2.html#passage-106'>&sect;106</a> defines as mundane right view:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits &amp; results of good &amp; bad actions. There is this world &amp; the next world. There is mother &amp; father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are contemplatives &amp; brahmans who, faring rightly &amp; practicing rightly, proclaim this world &amp; the next after having directly known &amp; realized it for themselves.</p>
</div>

<p>As noted in <a href="part2.html#dana1-2h">II/H</a>, this passage means that there is merit in generosity; that the moral qualities of good and bad are inherent in the universe, and not simply social conventions; that there is life after death; that one has a true moral debt to one's parents; and that there are people who have lived the renunciate's life properly in such a way that they have gained true and direct knowledge of these matters. These beliefs form the minimum prerequisite for following the path to skillfulness. If one <a id='doubt-3a'>doubts</a> them, one will find it difficult to muster the energy or commitment needed to develop skillful qualities in the mind. One would be more likely to revert to the selfish gratification of immediate desires, with little thought for right or wrong. The willingness to accept these beliefs on faith thus counts as the first step from the stage of mere acquaintance with the Buddha's teachings to the stage of commitment.</p>

<p>These beliefs form the basis for the three points mentioned above as the teachings of good people: generosity, going forth, and service to one's parents [<a href='part3.html#passage-119'>&sect;119</a>]. Appreciating the value of these principles, and following them to the extent of one's abilities, enables one to develop the proper character needed for comprehending the higher levels of the Buddha's teachings, culminating in the four noble truths. As <a id='sotapanna3'>the first list of factors of stream-entry</a> points out, simply listening to the Dhamma is not enough. One has to develop appropriate attention as well, which as we have already seen [<a href="part2.html#part2-g">II/G</a>] involves knowing how to focus on the right questions. In this context, one begins by learning how to ask productive questions of one's teacher and then moves on to using the <a id='fournoble-3a'>categories</a> of the four noble truths to ask questions of one's experience in general. In this sense, the act of listening and paying appropriate attention covers the first two levels in the development of discernment &mdash; understanding based on listening and on reasoning &mdash; and gets one started on the third: understanding based on the development of skillful qualities in the mind [DN 33].</p>

<p>Although <a id='yoniso2-3a'>listening to the Dhamma</a> is a prerequisite for appropriate attention, appropriate attention does not follow automatically from listening to the Dhamma. It has to be consciously cultivated; otherwise, the causal process will not lead to clear knowledge and release. This point is expressed in a famous stanza from the Dhammapada (64-65):</p>

<div class="excerpt freeverse">
Even if for a lifetime
the fool stays with the wise,
he knows nothing of the Dhamma &mdash;
	as the <a id="ladle-3a">ladle</a>,
	the taste of the soup.
Even if for a moment,
a perceptive person stays with the wise,
he knows the Dhamma &mdash;
	as the tongue,
	the taste of the soup.
</div>

<p>The purpose of meditation, in which one consciously develops mindfulness and discernment so as to master and understand the skillful use of the mind, is to turn one into the perceptive person who can fully understand the Dhamma.</p>

<p>With <a id='sotapanna4'>the attainment of stream-entry</a> at one's first taste of the Deathless, the intellectual aspect of conviction is expressed in terms of verified conviction in the Awakening of the Buddha [<a href='part2.html#passage-72'>&sect;72</a>], which branches out into verified conviction in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha [<a href='part2.html#passage-71'>&sect;71</a>]. One's own taste of Awakening verifies the reality of the Buddha's Awakening and that of the noble Sangha; one's understanding of how the Awakening came about through the practice of the Dhamma verifies that the noble eightfold path is the ideal synopsis of that practice, with nothing lacking or in excess. From this comes the standard expression of conviction in the Triple Gem: The Buddha is rightly self-awakened; the Dhamma, well taught; and the noble Sangha, worthy of honor [<a href='part2.html#passage-71'>&sect;71</a>]. What this means in practical terms is that one is now convinced beyond a doubt that the human ability to develop skillfulness can lead all the way to the Deathless, and that the Deathless is the highest excellence.</p>

<p>Several passages [<a href='part2.html#passage-87'>&sect;87</a>] emphasize that the experience of stream-entry reinforces one's conviction that the true Dhamma is fully expressed only in the Buddha's teachings. This point will come as a surprise to many people who are aware of Buddhism's long history of tolerance toward other religions, and who assume that the enlightened attitude toward alternative teachings is to endorse the statement that many roads lead to the top of the mountain. This assumption, though, is based on a confusion between "tolerance" and "endorsement." As we have already noted, from the streamwinner's point of view the noble eightfold path is the ideal expression of the way to Awakening. To endorse any other path to the same goal would be to concede that the noble eightfold path either lacks something essential or contains something superfluous. The Buddha is quoted as saying that any other supposed path to Awakening would by definition be wrong: wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, etc. To try to get results from such a path, he says, would be like trying to squeeze sesame oil out of gravel or to churn butter out of water [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.126.than.html">MN 126</a>]. He did not deny that other teachings, advocating virtue and concentration, can lead to states of great peace or to rebirth in <a id='loka-3a'>the higher heavens</a>, but if one views those attainments as equivalent to Unbinding, one is suffering from wrong view. To hold to that wrong view puts the total release to be found with Unbinding beyond reach.</p>

<p>This unwillingness to endorse other paths, however, does not necessarily lead to intolerance. Buddhism's basic premise is the principle of kamma, that happiness and suffering are the results of one's own past and present actions. The noble eightfold path grows out of this principle as the most skillful mode of action for escaping from the cycle of kammic retribution and attaining the Deathless. Other paths are either incomplete expressions of the noble eightfold path or are based on other principles. For example, they may state that there is a being who can sidestep the law of kamma and provide for one's happiness without one's having to master the skills of the noble eightfold path, or that certain ritual actions or words can provide a similar shortcut to happiness. People who follow either of these two latter beliefs could well feel threatened by outsiders who do not share their beliefs, for the outsiders are in effect denying the existence of a shortcut on which the insiders are placing their hopes. This explains why such people have often been intolerant of outside views.</p>

<p>But because the principle of kamma is a teaching of full personal responsibility, no one who believes in kamma will feel threatened by people who teach shortcuts around kamma. Buddhists who have yet to attain stream-entry may waver in their conviction &mdash; as the path can seem long and arduous, and the results slow in coming &mdash; and this is one reason why they are encouraged not to associate with anyone who rejects the principle of kamma. But those who have had their first taste of Awakening can in no way be persuaded to doubt the principle, for they have seen that the Deathless can be touched only through a process that requires the utmost skill in mindfulness and discernment applied to the processes of one's own mind. Their attitude toward other teachings is that of a skilled artisan toward those with lesser skills, or of a woman who has learned how to extract sesame oil from sesame seeds toward those who are still trying to extract it from gravel: she will want to teach them the right way if they are willing to listen, but if they are unwilling, she will tolerate their ignorance and hope that someday they will be ready to learn.</p>

<p>To attain this level of unshakable conviction requires that one put the Dhamma into practice. This shows the intimate relationship between the intellectual and practical aspects of conviction: one must have a certain level of intellectual understanding of the doctrinal Dhamma before one can practice it, and one must practice it to the point of touching the Dhamma of Deathlessness as an attainment before one's conviction in the teaching of the Dhamma can become unshakably firm. <a id='comment1-3a'>The commentaries</a> bring out this relationship by applying the term Dhamma to all three of these levels: doctrine, practice, and attainment, or in other words, Dhamma as an object of awareness (on the intellectual level), as a means of releasing awareness from bondage to its objects (on the practical level), and as the awareness released (at the point of Awakening).</p>

<p>The <b>practical aspect</b> of conviction, prior to stream-entry, is covered by the factor of stream-entry called "practicing in accordance with the Dhamma." What this factor means is that one must be willing to put the Dhamma ahead of one's preferences, so that one is not practicing simply in line with one's likes and dislikes. This is the true test of one's conviction. It is all too easy to pick and choose from the teachings on the basis of other standards &mdash; here in the West it is common to judge the Dhamma against Western psychology or other social sciences, and to pick and choose accordingly &mdash; but one must ask oneself the same question that Prince Siddhattha posed for himself: Which is a more worthwhile use of one's time, the pursuit of objects and ideals subject to change and death, or the pursuit of the Deathless? Although there is a long-standing recognition in the Buddhist tradition that people benefit even if they follow only part of the teaching, the Dhamma can give its full results only if one commits oneself fully to developing the skill of release in one's thoughts, words, and deeds. This training is similar to following a doctor's regimen. One will benefit even from following the regimen only occasionally, but a full cure requires sticking to the regimen consistently and putting the goal of recovery ahead of one's other preferences. The skill of release requires ordering one's priorities, taking the teachings and example of those who have attained that skill as one's primary guide, and regarding everything else as secondary.</p>

<p>With the attainment of stream-entry, one's conviction in the principle of kamma and its skillful mastery becomes so firm that one would not intentionally break any of the basic precepts that comprise right speech, right action, or right livelihood. This is the import of the factor of stream-entry called "virtues appealing to the noble ones." In addition to virtue, streamwinners have also begun to develop the other two aggregates in the noble path &mdash; concentration and discernment &mdash; but those two aggregates are not yet fully matured [<a href="part2.html#part2-a">II/A</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-4.html#p103">MFU, pp. 103-104</a>]. As <a href='part2.html#passage-74'>&sect;74</a> &amp; <a href='part2.html#passage-75'>&sect;75</a> make clear, conviction cannot become firm until the remaining four faculties, including concentration and discernment, have been strengthened to at least some extent. Once conviction does becomes firm, it can then function to strengthen those faculties even further. The streamwinner realizes, from the experience of stream-entry, not only that he/she attained that experience through mastery of the processes of kamma, but also that his/her Awakening is not yet complete because there are gaps in that mastery. This realization is what gives impetus for the further development of all five faculties until they issue in the full realization of the Deathless.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-115">&sect; 115</a>.</b> As he was seated to one side, Ven. &#256;nanda said to the Blessed One, 'This is half of the holy life, lord: admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie.'</p>

<p>'Don't say that, &#256;nanda. Don't say that. Admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, he can be expected to develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path.</p>

<p>'And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path? There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops right resolve... right speech... right action... right livelihood... right effort... right mindfulness... right concentration dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, develops &amp; pursues the noble eightfold path.</p>

<p>'And through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life: It's in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair have gained release from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair.'</p>

<h2><a id='part3-d'>D. Concentration: Abandoning the Hindrances</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>Several discourses in the Canon [such as <a href="../../../../tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html">DN 2</a>] state that the first step in concentration practice is to abandon the five hindrances, which we have already discussed in conjunction with the seven factors for Awakening [<a href="part2.html#part2-g">II/G</a>]. They are: sensual desire, ill will, sloth &amp; drowsiness, restlessness &amp; anxiety, and uncertainty. These hindrances need to be abandoned because they function as intermediate levels of the three roots of unskillfulness [<a href='part1.html#passage-3'>&sect;3</a>]. Sensual desire is a form of greed; ill will, a form of aversion; and the remaining three hindrances, forms of delusion. All five, in their various ways, block concentration and weaken discernment by making it difficult to realize what is beneficial for oneself, for others, or for both.</p>

<p>This last point makes them particularly tricky to deal with, for one needs to have a sense that they are unbeneficial states of mind before one can work at abandoning them, yet while one is overcome with them, they impair one's ability to see that they are in fact unbeneficial [<a href='part3.html#passage-133'>&sect;133</a>]. For instance, when one feels sensual desire for another person, it is hard to focus on the unattractive side of that person or on the drawbacks of the desire itself. Similarly, when one feels anger, it is hard not to feel that the anger is justified; when sleepy, it is hard not to feel that one should get some sleep; when worried, it is hard not to believe that one needs to worry, and so forth.</p>

<p>Although the hindrances cannot be totally relinquished prior to the various stages of Awakening, they can be lessened on a preliminary level to the point where the mind can settle down in jh&#257;na. This preliminary level is the focus of the passages in this section. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-159'>&sect;159</a> lists five methods for dealing with unskillful thoughts in the course of meditation. The passages included here focus almost exclusively on using the first two of those methods &mdash; replacing the unskillful thoughts with skillful ones, and contemplating the drawbacks of the unskillful thoughts until one feels repulsed by them &mdash; so as to escape from the power of any hindrances that have overcome the mind. Examples of the first method include focusing on the unattractive side of any sensual object to which one may be attracted [&sect;&sect;<a href='part2.html#passage-30'>30</a>, <a href='part3.html#passage-140'>140</a>, <a href='part3.html#passage-142'>142</a>]; focusing on the good qualities of a person who has aroused thoughts of ill will [<a href='part3.html#passage-144'>&sect;144</a>]; focusing on the foolishness of expecting all people to act in line with one's wants [<a href='part3.html#passage-145'>&sect;145</a>]; and changing one's object of concentration when finding that the current object is inducing sleepiness [<a href='part3.html#passage-147'>&sect;147</a>]. Examples of the second method include realizing that the hindrance is placing the mind in a state of bondage and limitation [&sect;&sect;<a href='part3.html#passage-134'>134</a>, <a href='part3.html#passage-137'>137-138</a>], and that one can find freedom only by releasing oneself from its power. In practice, these are not the only ways of applying these two general approaches. The examples in the texts can act as inspiration for any similar techniques that a meditator might devise to obtain the desired effect.</p>

<p>To escape the double bind mentioned above &mdash; the fact that the hindrances blind one to one's own true best interests, and yet one needs to see those true interests if one is to overcome the hindrances &mdash; one must depend on all five faculties as one has been able to develop them. <a id='convict1-3d'>Conviction</a> is needed so that one will listen to the advice of those who point out the drawbacks of the hindrances. A certain momentum of persistence, as right exertion, is needed so that one will make the effort to abandon the hindrance as soon as one is aware that it has arisen and before it grows into anything stronger. Mindfulness, based on the frames of reference, is needed so that one can be alert to the arising of the hindrances and can remember why they should be abandoned in the first place. This mindfulness can be strengthened by remembering the teachings of others who have pointed out the drawbacks of the hindrances &mdash; the many similes for the hindrances given in passages <a href='part3.html#passage-131'>&sect;&sect;131-134</a> and <a href='part3.html#passage-138'>&sect;138</a> serve the purpose of keeping those memories vivid. It can also be strengthened by remembering the drawbacks of the hindrances as encountered in one's own personal experience: the damage that has come when another person has given in to them, and the things that one regrets having done oneself when under their influence.</p>

<p>Because preliminary levels of concentration and discernment are present in right exertion and the practice of the frames of reference, these faculties play a role in abandoning the hindrances as well. As they develop strength, they make one more and more skilled in cutting off the hindrances as effectively as possible. The seven factors for Awakening, which are developed in concentration, act as direct antidotes to the hindrances [<a href='part2.html#passage-76'>&sect;76</a>], while discernment &mdash; combined with concentrated mindfulness &mdash; helps in mastering what is probably the most effective tool for not being fooled by the hindrances: the ability to separate the hindrance, as an act of the mind, from its object.</p>

<p>For instance, discernment makes one able to see the feeling of sensual desire as one thing, and the object of the desire as something separate. This ability is crucial in a number of ways. To begin with, it helps separate the positive qualities of the object from the act of desiring the object, so that one does not confuse the two. The tendency to confuse the two is what makes it hard to see the drawbacks of the desire when it is present in the mind, and at the same time, serves to harden the mind in general against the Buddha's admonishments against sensuality.</p>

<p>There is a widespread feeling that Buddhism gives an unfair valuation of sensuality and is blind to the positive beauties of sensual objects, but this is simply not true. The Buddha admitted that sensual objects have their beauty and can give a measure of satisfaction [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.013.than.html">MN 13</a>]. He pointed out, however, that the beauty of an object is not the whole story, for all beautiful objects must decay. If one's happiness is based on them, that happiness is in for a fall.</p>

<p>More importantly, though, the Buddha defined sensuality not as the objects of the senses, but as the passion and delight that one feels for ones intentions toward such objects [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/an/an06/an06.063.than.html">AN 6.63</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p53">MFU, p. 53</a>]. Although the objects of the senses are neither good nor evil <i>per se,</i> the act of passion and delight forms a bond on the mind, disturbing its immediate peace and ensuring its continued entrapment in the round of rebirth and redeath. Only by separating the desire from its object can one directly perceive the truth of these teachings.</p>

<p>This point applies to the other hindrances as well. For instance, when one can separate the object of one's anger from the anger itself as a mental event, one can see the obvious drawbacks of allowing anger to take over the mind.</p>

<p>In addition, the ability to separate the act from its object enables one to become sensitive to the act before it becomes overpowering, at the same time allowing one to regard it simply as a mental quality in and of itself. One can then engage in the practice outlined in <a href='part2.html#passage-30'>&sect;30</a> &mdash; that of observing the coming and going of the hindrances as one tries to bring the mind to concentration. In this way, one eventually becomes so familiar with the patterns underlying their occurrence that one can undercut them and eliminate them from the mind for good.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-137'>&sect;137</a> gives an example of one of the patterns that one will see when sensual desire arises: sexual attraction for another person begins with a sense of attraction for one's own sexuality. Passage <a href='part2.html#passage-96'>&sect;96</a>, in a more abstract fashion, lists other patterns of mind that feed the hindrances. By perceiving such patterns, one can take one's analysis of the roots of unskillfulness in the mind to ever more subtle levels. In this way, the skill of being able to abandon the hindrances will go beyond simply the preliminary level of concentration practice, exercising all five of the faculties to the point where they issue in Awakening.</p>

Then suppose his friends, companions, &amp; relatives brought a doctor to treat him. The doctor would concoct medicine, and by means of that medicine he would be cured of his leprosy: well &amp; happy, free, master of himself, going wherever he liked. Then suppose two strong men, having grabbed him with their arms, were to drag him to a pit of glowing embers. What do you think? Wouldn't he twist his body this way and that?</p>

<p>M&#257;gandiya: Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? The fire is painful to the touch, very hot &amp; scorching.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Now what do you think? Is the fire painful to the touch, very hot &amp; scorching, only now, or was it also that way before?</p>

<p>M&#257;gandiya: Both now &amp; before is it painful to the touch, very hot &amp; scorching. It's just that when the man was a leper... his faculties were impaired, which was why, even though the fire was actually painful to the touch, he had the skewed perception of 'pleasant.'</p>

<p>The Buddha: In the same way, sensuality in the past was painful to the touch, very hot &amp; scorching; sensuality in the future will be painful to the touch, very hot &amp; scorching; sensuality at present is painful to the touch, very hot &amp; scorching; but when beings are not free from passion for sensuality &mdash; devoured by sensual craving, burning with sensual fever &mdash; their faculties are impaired, which is why, even though sensuality is actually painful to the touch, they have the skewed perception of 'pleasant.'</p>

<p>Now suppose that there was a leper covered with sores &amp; infections, devoured by worms, picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embers. The more he cauterized his body over the pit of glowing embers, the more disgusting, foul-smelling, &amp; putrid the openings of his wounds would become, and yet he would feel a modicum of enjoyment &amp; satisfaction because of the itchiness of his wounds. In the same way, beings not free from passion for sensuality &mdash; devoured by sensual craving, burning with sensual fever &mdash; indulge in sensuality. The more they indulge in sensuality, the more their sensual craving increases and the more they burn with sensual fever, and yet they feel a modicum of enjoyment &amp; satisfaction dependent on the five strings of sensuality.</p>

<p>Now what do you think? Have you ever seen or heard of a king or king's minister &mdash; enjoying himself, provided &amp; endowed with the five strings of sensuality, without abandoning sensual craving, without removing sensual fever &mdash; who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst, his mind inwardly at peace?</p>

<p>M&#257;gandiya: No, Master Gotama.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Very good, M&#257;gandiya. Neither have I... But whatever contemplatives or brahmans who have dwelt or will dwell or are dwelling free from thirst, their minds inwardly at peace, all have done so having realized &mdash; as it has come to be &mdash; the origination &amp; disappearance, the allure, the danger, &amp; the escape from sensuality, having abandoned sensual craving and removed sensual fever.</p>

Not even if it <a id="coins141">rained gold coins</a>
would we have our fill
of sensual pleasures.
	'Stressful,

He is one who delights in the ending of craving,

<p><b><a id="passage-142">&sect; 142</a>.</b> As Subh&#257; the nun was going through <a id='jivaka142'>J&#299;vaka's</a> delightful mango grove, a libertine [a goldsmith's son] blocked her path, so she said to him:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
	"What wrong have I done you
that you stand in my way?
It's not proper, my friend,
that a man should touch
a woman gone forth.
I respect the Teacher's message,
the training pointed out by the one well-gone.
I am pure,	without blemish:
	Why do you stand in my way?
You &mdash; your mind agitated,
		I &mdash; unagitated;
You &mdash; impassioned,
		I &mdash; unimpassioned, unblemished,
		with a mind everywhere released:
	Why do you stand in my way?"

	"You are young &amp; not bad-looking,
what need do you have for going forth?
Throw off your ochre robe &mdash;
	Come, let's delight in the flowering forest.
A sweetness they exude from all around,
the towering trees with their pollen.
The beginning of spring is a pleasant season &mdash;
	 Come, let's delight in the flowering forest.
The trees with their blossoming tips
moan, as it were, in the breeze:
What delight will you have
if you plunge into the forest	alone?
Frequented by herds of wild beasts,
disturbed by elephants rutting &amp; aroused:
you want to go		unaccompanied
into the great, lonely, frightening forest?
Like a doll made of gold, you will go about,
like a goddess in the gardens of heaven.
With delicate, smooth <a id="kasi">K&#257;si</a> fabrics,
you will shine, O beauty without compare.
I would be under your power
if we were to dwell in the wood.
For there is no creature dearer to me
	 than you,
O nymph with the languid regard.
If you do as I ask, happy, come live in my house.
Dwelling in the calm of a palace,
	 have women wait on you,
	 wear delicate K&#257;si fabrics,
	 adorn yourself with garlands &amp; creams.
I will make you many &amp; varied ornaments
	 of gold, jewels, &amp; pearls.
Climb onto a costly bed,
scented with sandalwood carvings,
with a well-washed coverlet, beautiful,
spread with a woolen quilt, brand new.
Like a blue lotus rising from the water,
where there dwell non-human spirits,
you will go to old age with your limbs unseen,
if you stay as you are in the holy life."

	"What do you assume of any essence,
here in this cemetery grower, filled with corpses,
this body destined to break up?
What do you see when you look at me,
		you who are out of your mind?"

 	"Your eyes
are like those of a fawn,
like those of a nymph in the mountains.
Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight
	grows all the more.
Like tips they are, of blue lotuses,
in your golden face
	&mdash; spotless:
Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight
	grows all the more.
Even if you should go far away,
I will think only of your pure,
	long-lashed gaze,
for there is nothing dearer to me
	than your eyes,
O nymph with the languid regard."

    "You want to stray from the road,
you want the moon as a plaything,
you want to jump over Mount <a id='sineru'>Sineru</a>,
you who have designs on one born of the Buddha.
For there is nothing anywhere at all
in the world with its devas,
that would be an object of passion for me.
	I don't even know what that passion would be,
	for it's been killed, root &amp; all, by the path.
<a id="embers">Like embers</a> from a pit &mdash; scattered,
<a id="bowl">like a bowl of poison</a> &mdash; evaporated,
	I don't even see what that passion would be,
	for it's been killed, root &amp; all, by the path.
Try to seduce one who hasn't reflected on this,
or who the Teacher hasn't instructed.
But try it with this one who knows
	and you do yourself violence.
For whether insulted or worshiped,
	in pleasure or pain,
my mindfulness stands firm.
Knowing the unattractiveness
	of fabricated things,
my heart adheres nowhere at all.
I am a follower of the one well-gone,
riding the vehicle of the eightfold way:
My arrow removed, effluent-free,
I delight, having gone to an empty dwelling.
For I have seen <a id="puppets142">well-painted puppets</a>,
hitched up with sticks &amp; strings,
made to dance in various ways.
When the sticks &amp; strings are removed,
thrown away, scattered, shredded,
smashed into pieces, not to be found,
	in what will the mind there make its home?
This body of mine, which is just like that,
when devoid of dhammas doesn't function.
When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn't function,
	in what will the mind there make its home?
Like a mural you've seen, painted on a wall,
smeared with yellow orpiment,
there your vision has been distorted,
meaningless your perception of a human being.
<a id="mirage">Like an evaporated</a> mirage,
<a id="gold">like a tree of gold</a> in a dream,
<a id="magic">like a magic show</a> in the midst of a crowd &mdash;
	you run blind after what is unreal.
<a id='ballofwax142'>Resembling a ball of sealing wax</a>,
set in a hollow,
with a bubble in the middle
&amp; bathed with tears,
eye secretions are born there too:
The parts of the eye
are rolled all together
in various ways."

Plucking out her lovely eye,
with mind unattached
she felt no regret.

"Here, take this eye. It's yours."

Straightaway she gave it to him.
Straightaway his passion faded right there,
and he begged her forgiveness.

"Be safe, follower of the holy life.
	This sort of thing
	won't happen again.
Harming a person like you
is like embracing a blazing fire,
It's as if I have seized a poisonous snake.
So may you be safe. Forgive me."

And freed from there, the nun
went to the excellent Buddha's presence.
When she saw the mark of his excellent merit,
	her eye became
	as it was before.

<p>There are some people who are impure in their verbal behavior but pure in their bodily behavior. Hatred for a person of this sort should also be subdued.</p>

<p>There are some people who are pure in their bodily behavior &amp; their verbal behavior, and who periodically experience mental clarity &amp; calm. Hatred for a person of this sort should also be subdued.</p>

<p>Now as for a person who is impure in his bodily behavior but pure in his verbal behavior, how should one subdue hatred for him? Just as when a monk who makes use of things that are thrown away sees a <a id='rag144'>rag in the road</a>: taking hold of it with his left foot and spreading it out with his right, he would tear off the sound part and go off with it. In the same way, when the individual is impure in his bodily behavior but pure in his verbal behavior, one should at that time pay no attention to the impurity of his bodily behavior, and instead pay attention to the purity of his verbal behavior. Thus the hatred for him should be subdued.</p>

<p>And as for a person who is impure in his verbal behavior, but pure in his bodily behavior, how should one subdue hatred for him? Just as when there is a <a id='pool144'>pool</a> overgrown with slime &amp; water plants, and a person comes along, burning with heat, covered with sweat, exhausted, trembling, &amp; thirsty. He would jump into the pool, part the slime &amp; water plants with both hands, and then, cupping his hands, drink the water and go on his way. In the same way, when the individual is impure in his verbal behavior but pure in his bodily behavior, one should at that time pay no attention to the impurity of his verbal behavior, and instead pay attention to the purity of his bodily behavior. Thus the hatred for him should be subdued.</p>

<p>And as for a person who is impure in his bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior, but who periodically experiences mental clarity &amp; calm, how should one subdue hatred for him? Just as when there is a little <a id='puddle144'>puddle</a> in a cow's footprint, and a person comes along, burning with heat, covered with sweat, exhausted, trembling, &amp; thirsty. The thought would occur to him, 'Here is this little puddle in a cow's footprint. If I tried to drink the water using my hand or cup, I would disturb it, stir it up, &amp; make it unfit to drink. What if I were to get down on all fours and slurp it up like a cow, and then go on my way?' So he would get down on all fours, slurp up the water like a cow, and then go on his way. In the same way, when an individual is impure in his bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior, but periodically experiences mental clarity &amp; calm, one should at that time pay no attention to the impurity of his bodily behavior... the impurity of his verbal behavior, and instead pay attention to the fact that he periodically experiences mental clarity &amp; calm. Thus the hatred for him should be subdued.</p>

<p>And as for a person who is impure in his bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior, and who does not periodically experience mental clarity &amp; calm, how should one subdue hatred for him? Just as when there is a <a id='sickman144'>sick man</a> &mdash; in pain, seriously ill &mdash; traveling along a road, far from the next village &amp; far from the last, unable to get the food he needs, unable to get the medicine he needs, unable to get a suitable assistant, unable to get anyone to take him to human habitation. Now suppose another person were to see him coming along the road. He would do what he could out of compassion, pity, &amp; sympathy for the man, thinking, 'O that this man should get the food he needs, the medicine he needs, a suitable assistant, someone to take him to human habitation. Why is that? So that he won't fall into ruin right here.' In the same way, when a person is impure in his bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior, and who does not periodically experience mental clarity &amp; calm, one should do what one can out of compassion, pity, &amp; sympathy for him, thinking, 'O that this man should abandon wrong bodily conduct and develop right bodily conduct, abandon wrong verbal conduct and develop right verbal conduct, abandon wrong mental conduct and develop right mental conduct. Why is that? So that, on the breakup of the body, after death, he won't fall into the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell.' Thus the hatred for him should be subdued.</p>

<p>And as for a person who is pure in his bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior, and who periodically experiences mental clarity &amp; calm, how should one subdue hatred for him? Just as when there is a pool of clear water &mdash; sweet, cool, &amp; limpid, with gently sloping banks, &amp; shaded on all sides by trees of many kinds &mdash; and a person comes along, burning with heat, covered with sweat, exhausted, trembling, &amp; thirsty. Having plunged into the pool, having bathed &amp; drunk &amp; come back out, he would sit down or lie down right there in the shade of the trees. In the same way, when an individual is pure in his bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior, and periodically experiences mental clarity &amp; calm, one should at that time pay attention to the purity of his bodily behavior... the purity of his verbal behavior, and to the fact that he periodically experiences mental clarity &amp; calm. Thus the hatred for him should be subdued. An entirely inspiring individual can make the mind grow serene.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-147">&sect; 147</a>. Sloth &amp; drowsiness.</b> Once the Blessed One was living among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park at Bhesakal&#257; Grove, near Crocodile Haunt. At that time <a id='moggallana147'>Ven. Mah&#257; Moggall&#257;na</a> [prior to his Awakening] sat nodding near the village of Kallavalaputta, in Magadha. The Blessed One saw this with his purified divine eye, surpassing the human, and as soon as he saw this &mdash; just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm &mdash; disappeared from the Deer Park... appeared right in front of Ven. Mah&#257; Moggall&#257;na, and sat down on a prepared seat. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to Ven. Mah&#257; Moggall&#257;na, 'Are you nodding, Moggall&#257;na? Are you nodding?'</p>

<p>'Yes, lord.'</p>

<p>'Well then, Moggall&#257;na, whatever perception you have in mind when drowsiness descends on you, don't attend to that perception, don't pursue it. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>

<p>'But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then recall to your awareness the Dhamma as you have heard &amp; memorized it, re-examine it &amp; ponder it over in your mind. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>

<p>'But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then repeat aloud in detail the Dhamma as you have heard &amp; memorized it. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>

<p>'But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then pull both your earlobes and rub your limbs with your hands. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>

<p>'But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then get up from your seat and, after washing your eyes out with water, look around in all directions and upward to the major stars &amp; constellations. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>

<p>'But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then attend to the perception of light, resolve on the perception of daytime, (dwelling) by night as by day, and by day as by night. By means of an awareness thus open &amp; unhampered, develop a brightened mind [<a href='part2.html#passage-66'>&sect;66</a>]. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>

<p>'But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then &mdash; percipient of what lies in front &amp; behind &mdash; set a distance to meditate walking back &amp; forth, your senses inwardly immersed, your mind not straying outward. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>

<p>'But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then &mdash; reclining on your right side &mdash; take up the lion's posture, one foot placed on top of the other, mindful, alert, with your mind set on getting up. As soon as you wake up, get up quickly, with the thought, "I won't stay indulging in the pleasure of lying down, the pleasure of reclining, the pleasure of drowsiness."</p>

<p>'Thus, Moggall&#257;na, should you train yourself...'</p>

<h2><a id='part3-e'>E. Right Concentration</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>The passages in this section deal with <a id="rconc1-3e">right concentration</a> in terms of three questions that deserve appropriate attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is right concentration?</li>
<li>How is it mastered?</li>
<li>How can it be put to use?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer <b>the first question:</b> Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-148'>&sect;148</a> defines concentration as singleness of mind, but not every instance of mental singleness counts as right concentration. Passage <a href='part2.html#passage-102'>&sect;102</a> identifies right concentration with the four levels of jh&#257;na &mdash; meditative absorption &mdash; and <a href='part3.html#passage-152'>&sect;152</a> makes the point that jh&#257;na can be considered right concentration only if it is devoid of unskillful qualities such as the hindrances. Absorption in sensual passion, for instance, even though it may be very single-minded, does not count as part of the path. Thus the definition for the first level of jh&#257;na specifies that it counts as a path factor only when the mind is secluded from sensuality and unskillful mental qualities.</p>
<p>The singleness of jh&#257;na means not only that awareness is focused on a single object, but also that the object is reduced to a single quality that fills the entirety of one's awareness, at the same time that one's awareness broadens to suffuse the entire object. This mutual pervasion of awareness and object in a state of expansion is what is meant by <i>absorption.</i> The similes used to illustrate the various levels of jh&#257;na repeatedly make mention of "expansion," "suffusing," "stretching," and "filling" [<a href='part3.html#passage-150'>&sect;150</a>; also <a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.121.than.html">MN 121</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p82">MFU, pp. 82-85</a>], culminating in the fourth jh&#257;na where one's body is filled with a bright sense of awareness. This sense of expansion and making-single is also indicated in passages that teach specific meditation techniques. The directions for keeping the <a id='breath-3e'>breath</a> in mind, for instance, state that one should be sensitive to the entire body while breathing in and out. This accounts for the term <i>"mahaggata"</i> &mdash; enlarged or expanded &mdash; used to describe the mind in the state of jh&#257;na.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of jh&#257;na, which the <a id='comment1-3e'>commentaries</a> term "form jh&#257;na" <i>(rupa jh&#257;na)</i> and "formless jh&#257;na" <i>(arupa jh&#257;na).</i> Each type has several levels. In the case of form jh&#257;na, different passages in the Canon list the levels in different ways. The differences revolve around two different senses of the word "form." In one sense, "form" denotes the body, and form jh&#257;na is a state of mental absorption in the form of one's own physical body, as sensed from within. Jhana focused on this type of form comes in four levels, identical with the four levels mentioned in the definition of the faculty of concentration [<a href='part2.html#passage-72'>&sect;72</a>] and of right concentration under the noble eightfold path [<a href='part2.html#passage-102'>&sect;102</a>]. In another sense, "form" can also denote the visible forms and light that some meditators can see in the mind's eye in the course of their meditation. This type of form jh&#257;na is analyzed into two patterns, one with two levels [<a href='part3.html#passage-164'>&sect;164</a>], the other with three [<a href='part3.html#passage-163'>&sect;163</a>]. Both patterns end with the perception of the "beautiful," which in terms of its function is equivalent to the sense of radiance filling the body on the fourth level of "body form" jh&#257;na.</p>

<p>For a person practicing form jh&#257;na in either sense of the term, the equanimity experienced with the sense of beautiful radiance can then act as the basis for the formless levels of jh&#257;na, which the Canon terms the four "formlessnesses beyond form." These are invariably defined as progressive absorption in the perceptions of "infinite space," "infinite consciousness," and "there is nothing," leading to a fourth state of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

<p>As for <b>the second question,</b> on how to <a id='jhana-3e'>master right concentration</a>: Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-154'>&sect;154</a> notes that the ability to attain the first level of jh&#257;na &mdash; however one experiences the "form" acting as its focus &mdash; depends on the abandoning of the hindrances, because the feeling of freedom that comes with their abandoning provides the sense of joy and pleasure that lets the mind settle skillfully in the present moment. How to master this process is best shown by following the Buddha's most detailed set of meditation instructions &mdash; the sixteen steps in the practice of keeping the breath in mind [<a href='part3.html#passage-151'>&sect;151</a>] &mdash; and comparing them with the standard description of the four stages of jh&#257;na [<a href='part3.html#passage-149'>&sect;&sect;149-150</a>]. Before we analyze these maps of the practice, however, we must make a few comments on how to use them skillfully.</p>

<p>To begin with, internal obstacles to the practice of jh&#257;na do not end with the preliminary ground-clearing of the hindrances discussed in the preceding section. More refined levels of unskillful mental states can get in the way [<a href='part3.html#passage-160'>&sect;&sect;160-61</a>]. Lapses in mindfulness and alertness can leave openings for the hindrances to return. Thus, although the maps of the various stages of concentration proceed in a smooth, seemingly inevitable progression, the actual experience of the practice does not. For this reason, the Buddha gives specific instructions on how to deal with these obstacles as they arise in the course of the practice. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-159'>&sect;159</a> lists five basic approaches, the first two of which we have already covered in the preceding section. The remaining three are:</p>

<p>1) One ignores the obstacles. This works on the principle that paying attention to the distraction feeds the distraction, just as paying attention to a crazy person &mdash; even if one is simply trying to drive him away &mdash; encourages him to stay.</p>

<p>2) One notices that the act of thinking a distracting thought actually takes more energy than not thinking the thought, and one consciously relaxes whatever tension or energy happens to accompany it. This approach works best when one is sensitive enough to bodily sensations to see the pattern of physical tension that appears in conjunction with the thought, and can intentionally relax it.</p>

<p>3) The approach of last resort is simply to exert force on the mind to drive out the distracting thought. This is a temporary stopgap measure that works only as long as mindfulness is firm and determination strong. It is useful in cases where discernment is not yet sharp enough to make the other approaches work, but once discernment is up to the task, the other approaches are more effective in the long run.</p>

<p>Another point to keep in mind in understanding the maps of the practice is that they list the steps of meditation, not in the order in which they will be experienced, but in the order in which they can be mastered. There are cases, for instance, where one will feel rapture in the course of the practice (step 5 in the practice of breath meditation) before one is able to breath in and out sensitive to the entire body (step 3). In such cases, it is important not to jump to any conclusions as to one's level of attainment, or to feel that one has bypassed the need to master an earlier step. Instead &mdash; when several different experiences arise together in a jumble, as they often do &mdash; one should use the maps to tell which experience to focus on first for the sake of developing one's meditation as a skill.</p>

<p>One qualification here is that it is not necessary to master all the levels of concentration in order to gain Awakening. The relationship of concentration to discernment is a controversial issue, which we will cover in the following section, but here we may simply note that many texts [<a href='part3.html#passage-173'>&sect;&sect;173-74</a>] point out that the experience of the first jh&#257;na can be a sufficient basis for the discernment leading to Awakening. The same holds true for the first four steps in breath meditation, which constitute one of the alternative ways of developing the body in and of itself as a frame of reference [<a href='part2.html#passage-30'>&sect;30</a>]. In this case, one's practice of breath meditation would jump from a mastery of step 4 straight to step 13, skipping the intervening steps. In fact, beginning with step 4, it is possible to jump directly to 13 from any of the steps, and from there to progress all the way to Awakening.</p>

<p>The fact that the higher stages are unnecessary in some cases, however, does not mean that they are superfluous. Many people, as they develop the skill of their meditation, will find that their minds naturally go to deeper levels of stillness with no liberating insight arising. For them, the maps are valuable aids for a number of reasons. To begin with, the maps can help indicate what does and does not count as Awakening. When one arrives at a new, more refined level of awareness in one's practice, it is easy to assume that one has attained the goal. Comparing one's experience to the maps, however, can show that the experience is simply a higher level of concentration. Furthermore, awareness of the distinct levels can help one review them after attaining them, so that in the course of trying to master them, moving from one level to another, one can begin to gain insight into the element of will and fabrication that goes into them. This insight can then provide an understanding into the pattern of cause and effect in the mind and, as passage <a href='part3.html#passage-182'>&sect;182</a> shows, can lead to a sense of dispassion and ultimately to Awakening.</p>

<p>However, the maps should not be used to plan one's practice in advance. This is the message of <a href='part3.html#passage-162'>&sect;162</a>, which makes the point that one should not try to use one's knowledge of the various levels of the practice to force one's way through them. In other words, one should not try to concoct a particular state of jh&#257;na based on ideas picked up from the maps. On reaching a particular level, one should not be in a hurry to go to the next. Instead, one should familiarize oneself with that level of mind, perfecting one's mastery; eventually that state of concentration will ripen naturally into the next level. To continue the image of the passage, one will find that there is no need to jump to another pasture to taste different grass and water, for the new grass and water will develop right in one's own pasture.</p>

<p>Finally, although the maps to the various stages of concentration seem exhaustive and complete, bear in mind that they list only the stages of <i>right</i> concentration, and not the varieties of wrong. In addition to the types of <a id='wconc1-3e'>wrong concentration</a> mentioned in <a href='part3.html#passage-152'>&sect;152</a>, there are states of mind that may be very quiet but lack the mindfulness that would make them right. One of these stages is a blurred state &mdash; essentially a concentration of delusion &mdash; half-way between waking and sleep, in which one's object becomes hazy and ill-defined. On leaving it, one is hard put to say where the mind was focused, or whether it was awake or asleep.</p>

<p>Another type of wrong concentration is one that a modern practice tradition, following DN 1, calls a state of non-perception<i> (asa&ntilde;&ntilde;i).</i> In this state, which is essentially a concentration of subtle aversion &mdash; the result of a strongly focused determination not to stay with any one object &mdash; everything seems to cease: the mind blanks out, with no perception of sights or sounds, or of one's own body or thoughts. There is just barely enough mindfulness to know that one hasn't fainted or fallen asleep. One can stay there for long periods of time, and yet the experience will seem momentary. One can even determine beforehand when one will leave the state; but on emerging from it, one may feel somewhat dazed or drugged, a reaction caused by the intense aversive force of the concentration that induced the state to begin with. There are other forms of wrong concentration, but a general test is that right concentration is a mindful, fully alert state. Any state of stillness without clear mindfulness and alertness is wrong.</p>

<p>With these points in mind we can now turn to the maps to see their answer to the question of how breath meditation leads to the mastery of jh&#257;na. As noted above, the practice of keeping the breath in mind is the meditation method that the Canon teaches in most detail. There are two possible reasons for this, one historical and the other more theoretical. From the historical point of view, the breath was the focal point that the Buddha himself used on the night of his own Awakening. From the theoretical perspective, a state of concentration focused on the breath is the meeting place of all the elements of the factor of "fabrication" <i>(sankhara)</i> in the formula for <a id='dependent-3e'>dependent co-arising</a> [&sect;&sect;<a href='part3.html#passage-218'>218</a>, <a href='part3.html#passage-223'>223</a>]. This factor, as experienced in the present, consists of bodily fabrication (the breath itself), verbal fabrication (the factors of directed thought and evaluation applied to the breath in the first jh&#257;na), and mental fabrication (feeling and perception, in this case the feelings of pleasure and equanimity experienced in the four jhanas, plus the mental label of "breath" or "form" that act as the basis for the state of jh&#257;na). Because transcendent discernment must deal directly with these three types of fabrication if it is to eliminate the ignorance that underlies them, the practice of jh&#257;na based on the breath is an ideal point to focus on all three at once.</p>

<p>The first two steps of breath meditation [<a href='part3.html#passage-151'>&sect;151</a>] involve simple tasks of directed thought and evaluation: directing one's thoughts and attention to the breath in and of itself, in the present, at the same time evaluating it as one begins to discern variations in the length of the breath. Some modern teachers maintain that the factor of evaluation here also includes taking one's observations of short and long breathing as a basis for adjusting the rhythm of the breath to make it as comfortable as possible. Because the first level of jh&#257;na must be based on a sense of pleasure [<a href='part3.html#passage-238'>&sect;238</a>], this advice is very practical.</p>

<p>The remaining steps are willed or determined: One "trains oneself," first by manipulating one's sense of conscious awareness, making it sensitive to the body as a whole. Then one can begin manipulating the bodily sensations of which one is aware, reducing them to a single sensation of calm by letting "bodily fabrication" &mdash; the breath &mdash; grow calm so as to create an easeful sense of rapture and pleasure. A comparison between the stages of breath meditation and the graphic analogies for jh&#257;na [<a href='part3.html#passage-150'>&sect;150</a>] indicates that the fifth and sixth steps &mdash; being sensitive to rapture and pleasure &mdash; involve making these feelings "single" as well, by letting them suffuse the entire body, just as the bathman kneads the moisture throughout his ball of bath powder. With bodily fabrications stilled, mental fabrications &mdash; feelings and perceptions &mdash; become clearly apparent as they occur, just as when a radio is precisely tuned to a certain frequency, static is eliminated and the message sent by the radio station broadcasting at that frequency becomes clear. These mental fabrications, too, are calmed, a step symbolized in the analogies for jh&#257;na by the still waters in the simile for the third level, in contrast to the spring waters welling up in the second. What remains is simply a sense of the mind itself, corresponding to the level of fourth jh&#257;na, in which the body is filled from head to toe with a single sense of bright, radiant awareness. This completes the first level of frames-of-reference practice [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>].</p>

<p>Once this stage is reached, steps 10-12 indicate that one can now turn one's attention to consolidating one's mastery of concentration. One does this by reviewing the various levels of jh&#257;na, focusing not so much on the breath as on the mind as it relates to the breath. This allows a perception of the different ways in which the mind can be satisfied and steadied, and the different factors from which it can be released by taking it through the different levels of jh&#257;na &mdash; for example, releasing it from rapture by taking it from the second level to the third, and so forth [<a href='part3.html#passage-175'>&sect;175</a>]. One comes to see that although the breath feels different on the different levels of jh&#257;na, the cause is not so much the breath as it is the way the mind relates to the breath, shedding the various mental activities surrounding its single preoccupation. As one ascends through the various levels, directed thought and evaluation are stilled, rapture fades, and pleasure is abandoned.</p>

<p>Another way of consolidating one's skills in the course of these steps is to examine the subtle defilements that interfere with full mastery of concentration. The fact that one's focus is now on the mind makes it possible to see these defilements clearly, and then to steady the mind even further by releasing it from them. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-161'>&sect;161</a>, although aimed specifically at the problems faced by those who have visions in their meditation, gives a useful checklist of subtle mental defilements that can hamper the concentration of any meditator. The image of grasping the quail neither too loosely nor too tight has become a standard one in Buddhist meditation manuals.</p>

<p>The mastery of concentration developed in steps 9-12 provides an excellent chance to develop discernment into the pattern of cause and effect in the process of concentrating the mind, in that one must master the causal factors before one can gain the desired results in terms of satisfaction, steadiness, and release. Here we see at work the basic pattern of skillfulness mentioned in several earlier sections: that discernment is sharpened and strengthened by employing it in developing the skills of concentration. This would correspond to the <a id='secondframe-3e'>second level</a> of frames-of-reference meditation &mdash; focusing on the phenomenon of origination and passing away &mdash; mentioned in <a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>.</p>

<p>Another development that can happen during these steps &mdash; although this goes outside of the practice of breath meditation <i>per se</i> &mdash; is the discovery of how the equanimity developed in the fourth jh&#257;na can be applied to other refined objects of the mind. These are the four formless jhanas: the dimension of the infinitude of space, the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. These states may sound impossibly abstract, but in actual practice they grow directly from the way the mind relates to the still sense of the body in the fourth jh&#257;na. The first stage comes when the mind consciously ignores its perception (mental label) of the form of the body, attending instead to the remaining sense of space that surrounds and pervades that form; the second stage comes when the mind sheds its perception of "space," leaving a limitless sense of awareness; the third, when it lets go of the oneness of its perception of "awareness," leaving a perception of inactivity; and the fourth, when it sheds the perception of that lack of activity. That leaves a state where perception is so refined that it can hardly be called perception at all, even though it is still there. As one masters these steps, one realizes that whereas the first four levels of jh&#257;na differ in the type of activity the mind focuses on its one object, the four formless jhanas differ in their objects, as one level of mental labeling falls away to be replaced by a more subtle one.</p>

<p>Passages <a href='part3.html#passage-162'>&sect;162</a> and <a href='part3.html#passage-164'>&sect;164</a> list one more meditative attainment beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception &mdash; the cessation of feeling and perception &mdash; but this is qualitatively different from the others, in that a meditator cannot attain it without at the same time awakening to the level of at least <a id='anagami-3e'>non-returning</a>. The reason behind this is related, once more, to the factor of "fabrication" <i>(sankhara)</i> in dependent co-arising [<a href='part3.html#passage-218'>&sect;218</a>]. In the course of mastering the levels of jh&#257;na, verbal fabrication grows still as one enters the second jh&#257;na; bodily fabrication, as one enters the fourth; and mental fabrication, as one enters this last stage. For all three types of fabrication to stop, however, ignorance &mdash; the condition for fabrication &mdash; must stop as well, and this can happen only with the insight that leads to Awakening.</p>

<p>We have come to the end of the list of the stages of mastery in meditative attainment, but four steps in breath meditation remain unexplained. This is because, aside from the ninth level of attainment, the stages of mastery can all be attained without developing the discernment that constitutes Awakening, while the last four steps in breath meditation deal specifically with giving rise to that discernment. This brings us to <b>the third question</b> that was broached at the beginning of this introduction: how right concentration can be put to use.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-149'>&sect;149</a> lists four possible uses for concentration:</p>
<ul>
<li>a pleasant abiding in the here and now,</li>
<li>the attainment of knowledge and vision,</li>
<li>mindfulness and alertness, and</li>
<li>the ending of the <a id="asava1-3e">effluents</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first use is the simple enjoyment of the experience of jh&#257;na; the <a id='supra-3e'>second</a> relates to the first five supranormal powers [<a href="part2.html#part2-d">II/D</a>]. The third relates to the development of the frames of reference [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>]; and the fourth, to the discernment that constitutes Awakening. We have already discussed the second and third uses of concentration in the passages just cited in brackets. This leaves us with the first and fourth.</p>

<p><a id='jhana2-3e'>The Canon</a> [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.138.than.html">MN 138</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-4.html#p113">MFU, pp. 114-15</a>] notes that meditators can become "chained and fettered" to the attractions of the pleasure to be found in jh&#257;na. As a result, many meditators are afraid to let their minds settle into blissfully still states, for fear of becoming stuck. <a id='sotapanna1-3e'>The Canon</a>, however, never once states that stream-entry can be attained without at least some experience in jh&#257;na; and it states explicitly [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/an/an03/an03.088.than.html">AN 3.88</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-4.html#p103">MFU, p. 103</a>] that the attainment of non-returning requires a mastery of concentration. <a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.036.than.html">MN 36</a> relates that the turning point in the Buddha's own practice &mdash; when he abandoned the path of self-affliction and turned to the middle way &mdash; hinged on his realization that there is nothing blameworthy in the pleasure to be found in jh&#257;na. Thus, there is nothing to fear.</p>

<p>This pleasure plays an important function in the practice. To begin with, it enables the mind to stay comfortably in the present moment, helping it attain the stability it needs for gaining insight. This can be compared to a scientific experiment in which the measuring equipment needs to be absolutely steady in order to give reliable readings. Second, because a great deal of sensitivity is required to "tune" the mind to the refined pleasure of jh&#257;na, the practice serves to increase one's sensitivity, making one more acutely aware of even the most refined levels of stress as well. Third, because the pleasure and equanimity of jh&#257;na are more exquisite than sensory pleasures, and because they exist independently of the five senses, they can enable the mind to become less involved in sensory pleasures and less inclined to search for emotional satisfaction from them. In this sense, the skillful pleasures of jh&#257;na can act as a fulcrum for prying loose one's attachments to the less skillful pleasures of sensuality. The fact that fully mature mastery of jh&#257;na brings about the attainment of non-returning, the preliminary level of Awakening where sensual passion is abandoned, shows the necessary role that jh&#257;na plays in letting go of this particular defilement. Finally, the pleasure of jh&#257;na provides a place of rest and rehabilitation along the path when the mind's powers of discernment become dulled or it must be coaxed into the proper mood to accept some of the harsher lessons it needs to learn in order to abandon its cravings. Just as a person who is well-fed and rested is more open to receiving criticism than when he is tired and hungry, the mind is often more willing to admit its own foolishness and lack of skill when it is nourished by the pleasure of jh&#257;na than when it is not.</p>

<p>Thus, although the pleasure of jh&#257;na can become an obstacle if treated as an end in itself, there are phases of the practice where the pursuit of this form of pleasure is a useful strategy toward the fourth use of concentration: the ending of the mental <a id='asava2-3e'>effluents</a>. This fourth use is the topic of the next section, but here we can simply note that it is related to the fifth factor of <a id='nobleconc2-3e'>noble right concentration</a> mentioned in <a href='part3.html#passage-150'>&sect;150</a>. As the simile illustrating it suggests &mdash; with the standing <a id='reflecting150'>person reflecting</a> on the person sitting down &mdash; this factor is a pulling back or a lifting of the mind above the object of its absorption, without at the same time disturbing the absorption. This factor corresponds to steps 9 through 12 in the guide to breath meditation, in that one is able to focus on the way the mind relates to its object at the same time that the mind is actually in a state of concentration. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-172'>&sect;172</a> shows that this factor can be applied to any level of jh&#257;na except for the states of neither perception nor non-perception and the cessation of perception and feeling. As for those two states, one can reflect on their component factors only after leaving them. With the other states, one stays with the object, but one's prime focus is on the mind. One sees the various mental events that go into maintaining that state of concentration, and as one contemplates these events, one becomes struck by how inconstant they are, how fabricated and willed. This provides insight into how the present aspect of kamma &mdash; one's present intentions &mdash; shape one's present experience. It also gives insight into the general pattern of cause and effect in the mind.</p>

<p>Focusing on the inconstancy and unreliability of the factors in this pattern gives rise to the realization that they are also stressful and <a id='notself-3e'>not-self</a>: neither "me" nor "mine," but simply instances of the first noble truth [<a href="#part3-h-1">III/H/i</a>]. When this realization goes straight to the heart, there comes a sense of dispassion for any craving directed at them (the second noble truth) and an experience of their fading and cessation (the third). Finally, one relinquishes attachment not only to these events, but also to the discernment that sees through to their true nature (the fourth). This completes steps 13 through 16 in the guide to breath meditation, at the same time bringing the seven factors for Awakening to completion in a state "dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go [<a href='part2.html#passage-93'>&sect;93</a>]," where "letting go" would appear to be equivalent to the "relinquishment" in step 16. When one can simply experience the act of relinquishment without fashioning an identity around "doing" the relinquishing, one passes through the third stage of frames-of-reference meditation to the state of <a id='nonfash-3e'>non-fashioning</a> [&sect;&sect;<a href='part3.html#passage-179'>179</a>, <a href='part3.html#passage-183'>183</a>], which forms the threshold to release.</p>

<p>Even after attaining release, <a id='arahant1-3e'>the Arahant</a> continues to practice meditation, although now that the effluents are ended, the concentration is not needed to put them to an end. <a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.107.horn.html">MN 107</a> mentions that Arahants practice concentration both for the sake of a pleasant abiding in the here and now, and for mindfulness and alertness. A number of passages in the Canon mention the Buddha and his Arahant disciples exercising their supranormal powers, which shows that they were practicing concentration for the sake of attaining knowledge and vision as well, to use in instructing those around them. The description of the Buddha's passing away tells that he entered total Unbinding after exercising his mastery in the full range of jhanic attainments. Thus the practice of concentration is useful all the way to the point where one gains total release from the round of death and rebirth.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-149">&sect; 149</a>.</b> These are the four developments of concentration. Which four? There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now. There is the development of concentration that... leads to the attainment of knowledge &amp; vision. There is the development of concentration that... leads to mindfulness &amp; alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.</p>

<p>And what is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jh&#257;na: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jh&#257;na: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jh&#257;na, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of joys &amp; distresses &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jh&#257;na: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is the development of concentration that... leads to a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now.</p>

<p>And what is the development of concentration that... leads to the attainment of knowledge &amp; vision? There is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime [at any hour of the day]. Day (for him) is the same as night, night is the same as day. By means of an awareness open &amp; unhampered, he develops a brightened mind. This is the development of concentration that... leads to the attainment of knowledge &amp; vision. [&sect;&sect;<a href='part2.html#passage-64'>64</a>; <a href='part2.html#passage-66'>66</a>]</p>

<p>And what is the development of concentration that... leads to mindfulness &amp; alertness? There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Perceptions are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Thoughts are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. This is the development of concentration that... leads to mindfulness &amp; alertness. [<a href='part2.html#passage-30'>&sect;30</a>]</p>

<p>And what is the development of concentration that... leads to the ending of the effluents? There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising &amp; falling away with reference to the five clinging-aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such is feeling... Such is perception... Such are fabrications... Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.' This is the development of concentration that... leads to the ending of the effluents. [<a href='part3.html#passage-173'>&sect;173</a>]</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-150">&sect; 150</a>. Noble Right Concentration.</b> Now what, monks, is five-factored noble right concentration? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jh&#257;na: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion.</p>

<p>Just as if a skilled <a id='bathman150'>bathman</a> or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again &amp; again with water, so that his ball of bath powder &mdash; saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within &amp; without &mdash; would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion. This is the first development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jh&#257;na: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration.</p>

<p>Just like a <a id='lake150'>lake</a> with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from east, west, north, or south, and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate &amp; pervade, suffuse &amp; fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. This is the second development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>

<p>And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jh&#257;na, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equani-mous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture.</p>

<p><a id='lotus150'>Just as</a> in a blue-, white-, or red-lotus pond, there may be some of the blue, white, or red lotuses which, born &amp; growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated &amp; pervaded, suffused &amp; filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those blue, white, or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. This is the third development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>

<p>And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; stress &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of joys &amp; distresses &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jh&#257;na: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness.</p>

<p><a id='clothman150'>Just as</a> if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating his body with a pure, bright awareness.

<p>And furthermore, the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand, well attended to, well pondered, well tuned [well penetrated] by means of discernment.</p>

<p>Just as if one person were to reflect on another, or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person, or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down; even so, monks, the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand, well attended to, well pondered, well tuned by means of discernment. This is the fifth development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>

<p>There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>

<p>[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' [2] Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' [3] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' [4] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication, and to breathe out calming bodily fabrication.</p>

<p>[5] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture.' [6] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure.' [7] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication.' [8] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication.'</p>

<p>[9] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind.' [10] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind.' [11] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in steadying the mind'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out steadying the mind.' [12] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in releasing the mind'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out releasing the mind.'</p>

<p>[13] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy.' [14] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion [literally, fading]'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion.' [15] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation.' [16] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment'; he trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.'</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-152">&sect; 152</a>.</b> Vassak&#257;ra: Once, Master &#256;nanda, Master Gotama was living at Ves&#257;l&#299; in the Hall with the peaked roof in the Great Forest. I went to where he was staying in the Great Forest... and there he spoke in a variety of ways on jh&#257;na. Master Gotama was both endowed with jh&#257;na and made jh&#257;na his habit. In fact, he praised all sorts of jh&#257;na.</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: It was not the case that the Blessed One praised all sorts of jh&#257;na, nor did he criticize all sorts of jh&#257;na. And <a id='wconc152'>what sort of jh&#257;na</a> did he not praise? There is the case where a certain person dwells with his awareness overcome by sensual passion, obsessed with sensual passion. He does not discern the escape, as it has come to be, from sensual passion once it has arisen. Making that sensual passion the focal point, he absorbs himself with it, besorbs, resorbs, &amp; supersorbs himself with it.</p>

<p>He dwells with his awareness overcome by ill will... sloth &amp; drowsiness... restlessness &amp; anxiety... uncertainty, obsessed with uncertainty. He does not discern the escape, as it has come to be, from uncertainty once it has arisen. Making that uncertainty the focal point, he absorbs himself with it, besorbs, resorbs, &amp; supersorbs himself with it. This is the sort of jh&#257;na that the Blessed One did not praise.</p>

<p>And what sort of jh&#257;na did he praise? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jh&#257;na... the second jh&#257;na... the third jh&#257;na... the fourth jh&#257;na: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is the sort of jh&#257;na that the Blessed One praised.</p>

<p>Vassak&#257;ra: It would seem, Master &#256;nanda, that Master Gotama criticized the jh&#257;na that deserves criticism, and praised that which deserves praise.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-159">&sect; 159</a>. Distracting Thoughts.</b> When a monk is intent on the heightened mind, there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate times. Which five?</p>

<p>There is the case where evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; imbued with desire, aversion, or delusion &mdash; arise in a monk while he is referring to &amp; attending to a particular theme. He should attend to another theme, apart from that one, connected with what is skillful. When he is attending to this other theme... those evil, unskillful thoughts... are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. <a id='carpenter159'>Just as</a> a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out, drive out, &amp; pull out a large one; in the same way... he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>

<p>If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; imbued with desire, aversion, or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme, connected with what is skillful, he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts: 'Truly, these thoughts of mine are unskillful... blameworthy... these thoughts of mine result in stress.' As he is scrutinizing their drawbacks... those evil, unskillful thoughts... are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. <a id='young159'>Just as</a> a young woman &mdash; or man &mdash; fond of adornment, would be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck; in the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>

<p>If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; imbued with desire, aversion or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts, he should pay no mind &amp; pay no attention to those thoughts. As he is paying no mind &amp; paying no attention to them... those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. <a id='goodeyeman159'>Just as</a> a man with good eyes, not wanting to see forms that had come into range, would close his eyes or look away; in the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>

<p>If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; imbued with desire, aversion or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind &amp; paying no attention to those thoughts, he should attend to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts. As he is attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts... those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. <a id='quickman159'>Just as</a> the thought would occur to a man walking quickly, 'Why am I walking quickly? Why don't I walk slowly?' So he walks slowly. The thought occurs to him, 'Why am I walking slowly? Why don't I stand?' So he stands. The thought occurs to him, 'Why am I standing? Why don't I sit down?' So he sits down. The thought occurs to him, 'Why am I sitting? Why don't I lie down?' So he lies down. In this way, giving up the grosser posture, he takes up the more refined one. In the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>

<p>If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; imbued with desire, aversion or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts, then &mdash; with his teeth clenched &amp; his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth &mdash; he should beat down, constrain, &amp; crush his mind with his awareness. As &mdash; with his teeth clenched &amp; his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth &mdash; he is beating down, constraining, &amp; crushing his mind with his awareness... those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. <a id='strongman159'>Just as</a> a strong man, seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders, would beat him down, constrain, &amp; crush him; in the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>

<p>Now when a monk... attending to another theme... scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts... paying no mind &amp; paying no attention to those thoughts... attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts... beating down, constraining, &amp; crushing his mind with his awareness... steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it, he is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequences. He thinks whatever thought he wants to, and doesn't think whatever thought he doesn't. He has severed craving, thrown off the fetters, and &mdash; through the right penetration of conceit &mdash; has made an end of suffering &amp; stress.</p>

<p>The Buddha: You should become attuned to that theme.

I will act in such a way that uncertainty will not arise in me again.'</p>

<p>As I was remaining heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, I perceived light &amp; the vision of forms. But soon after that the light disappeared, together with the vision of forms. The thought occurred to me, 'What is the cause, what is the reason, why the light disappeared, together with the vision of forms?' Then it occurred to me, 'Inattention... sloth &amp; drowsiness... fear... elation... inertia arose in me, and because of the inattention... inertia my concentration fell away; when my concentration fell away, the light disappeared together with the vision of forms. I will act in such a way that uncertainty, inattention, sloth &amp; drowsiness, fear, elation, &amp; inertia will not arise in me again.'</p>

<p>As I was remaining heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute... it occurred to me, 'Excessive persistence [<a href='part2.html#passage-66'>&sect;66</a>] arose in me, and because of the excessive persistence my concentration fell away; when my concentration fell away, the light disappeared together with the vision of forms. <a id='quailman161'>Just as</a> if a man might hold a <a id='quail161'>quail</a> tightly with both hands, it would die then &amp; there; in the same way, excessive persistence arose in me...

<p>As I was remaining heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute... it occurred to me, 'Sluggish persistence [<a href='part2.html#passage-66'>&sect;66</a>] arose in me, and because of the sluggish persistence my concentration fell away; when my concentration fell away, the light disappeared together with the vision of forms.

I will act in such a way that uncertainty... excessive &amp; sluggish persistence will not arise in me again.'</p>

<p>As I was remaining heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute... it occurred to me, 'Longing... the perception of multiplicity... excessive absorption in forms arose in me, and because of the excessive absorption in forms my concentration fell away; when my concentration fell away, the light disappeared together with the vision of forms... I will act in such a way that uncertainty... longing, the perception of multiplicity, excessive absorption in forms will not arise in me again.'</p>

<p>When I knew, 'Uncertainty is a defilement of the mind,' I abandoned the uncertainty that was a defilement of the mind. [Similarly with inattention, sloth &amp; drowsiness, fear, elation, inertia, excessive persistence, sluggish persistence, longing, the perception of multiplicity, &amp; excessive absorption in forms.]</p>

<p>As I was remaining heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, I perceived light without seeing forms, or saw forms without perceiving light for a whole day, a whole night, a whole day &amp; night. The thought occurred to me, 'What is the cause, what is the reason...?' Then it occurred to me, 'When I attend to the theme of light without attending to the theme of forms, I perceive light without seeing forms. When I attend to the theme of forms without attending to the theme of light, I see forms without seeing light for a whole day, a whole night, a whole day &amp; night.'</p>

<p>As I was remaining heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, I perceived limited light &amp; saw limited forms; I perceived unlimited light &amp; saw unlimited forms for a whole day, a whole night, a whole day &amp; night.

When my concentration is unlimited, my sense of (inner) vision is unlimited. With an unlimited sense of vision I perceive unlimited light &amp; see unlimited forms for a whole day, a whole night, a whole day &amp; night'...</p>

<p>'I have abandoned those defilements of the mind. Let me develop concentration in three ways.' So [1] I developed concentration with directed thought &amp; evaluation. I developed concentration without directed thought but with a modicum of evaluation. I developed concentration without directed thought or evaluation. [2] I developed concentration with rapture... without rapture... [3] I developed concentration accompanied by enjoyment... accompanied by equanimity.</p>

<p>When my concentration with directed thought &amp; evaluation was developed, when my concentration without directed thought but with a modicum of evaluation... without directed thought or evaluation... with rapture... without rapture... accompanied by enjoyment... accompanied by equanimity was developed, then the knowledge &amp; vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release.

<p>The thought occurs to him, 'What if I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, were to enter &amp; remain in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling.' Without jumping at the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, he... enters &amp; remains in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling.</p>

<p>When a monk enters &amp; emerges from that very attainment, his mind is pliant &amp; malleable. With his pliant, malleable mind, limitless concentration is well developed. With his concentration well developed &amp; limitless, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know &amp; realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>

<h1><a id='part3-f'>F. Concentration &amp; Discernment</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>We noted in <a href="part2.html#part2-a">II/A</a> that some of the sets in the Wings to Awakening list jh&#257;na as a condition for discernment, whereas others list discernment as a condition for jh&#257;na. Place both of these patterns into the context of this/that conditionality, and they convey the point that jh&#257;na and discernment in practice are mutually supporting. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-171'>&sect;171</a> states this point explicitly, while <a href='part3.html#passage-165'>&sect;165</a> and <a href='part3.html#passage-166'>&sect;166</a> show that the difference between the two causal patterns relates to differences in meditators: some develop strong powers of concentration before developing strong discernment, whereas others gain a sound theoretical understanding of the Dhamma before developing strong concentration. In either case, both strong concentration and sound discernment are needed to bring about Awakening. Passage <a href='part2.html#passage-111'>&sect;111</a> makes the point that when the practice reaches the culmination of its development, concentration and discernment act in tandem. The passages in this section deal with this topic in more detail.</p>

<p>The role of <a id='jhana1-3f'>jh&#257;na</a> as a condition for transcendent discernment is one of the most controversial issues in the Theravada tradition. Three basic positions have been advanced in modern writings. One, following the commentarial tradition, asserts that jh&#257;na is not necessary for any of the four levels of Awakening and that there is a class of individuals &mdash; called "dry insight" meditators &mdash; who are "discernment-released" based on a level of concentration lower than that of jh&#257;na. A second position, citing a passage in the Canon [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/an/an03/an03.088.than.html">AN 3.88</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-4.html#p103">MFU, pp. 103</a>] stating that concentration is mastered only on the level of <a id='anagami-3f'>non-returning</a>, holds that jh&#257;na is necessary for the attainment of non-returning and <a id='arahant2-3f'>Arahantship</a>, but not for the lower levels of Awakening. The third position states that the attainment of at least the first level of jh&#257;na is essential for all four levels of Awakening.</p>

<p>Evidence from the Canon supports the third position, but not the other two. As <a href='part2.html#passage-106'>&sect;106</a> points out, the attainment of <a id='sotapanna-3f'>stream-entry</a> has eight factors, one of which is right concentration, defined as jh&#257;na. In fact, according to this particular discourse, jh&#257;na is the heart of the streamwinner's path. Secondly, there is no passage in the Canon describing the development of transcendent discernment without at least some skill in jh&#257;na. The statement that concentration is mastered only on the level of non-returning must be interpreted in the light of the distinction between mastery and attainment. A streamwinner may have attained jh&#257;na without mastering it; the discernment developed in the process of gaining full mastery over the practice of jh&#257;na will then lead him/her to the level of non-returning. As for the term "discernment-released," passage <a href='part3.html#passage-168'>&sect;168</a> shows that it denotes people who have become Arahants without experiencing the four formless jhanas. It does not indicate a person who has not experienced jh&#257;na.</p>

<p>Part of the controversy over this question may be explained by the fact that the <a id='comment1-3f'>commentaries</a> define jh&#257;na in terms that bear little resemblance to the canonical description. <i>The Path of Purification</i> &mdash; the cornerstone of the commentarial system &mdash; takes as its paradigm for meditation practice a method called <i><a id='kasina-3f'>kasina</a>,</i> in which one stares at an external object until the image of the object is imprinted in one's mind. This image then gives rise to a countersign that is said to indicate the attainment of threshold concentration, a necessary prelude to jh&#257;na. The text then tries to fit all other meditation methods into this mold, so that they too give rise to countersigns, but even by its own admission, breath meditation does not fit the mold very well. With the other methods, the stronger one's focus, the more vivid the object and the closer it is to producing a countersign; but with the breath, the stronger one's focus, the more subtle the breath and the harder it is to detect. As a result, the text states that only Buddhas and Buddhas' sons find the breath a congenial focal point for attaining jh&#257;na.</p>

<p>None of these assertions have any support in the Canon. Although a practice called kasina is mentioned tangentially in some of the discourses, the only point where it is described in any detail [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.121.than.html">MN 121</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p82">MFU, pp. 82-85</a>] makes no mention of staring at an object or gaining a countersign. If breath meditation were congenial only to Buddhas and their sons, there seems little reason for the Buddha to have taught it so frequently and to such a wide variety of people. If the arising of a countersign were essential to the attainment of jh&#257;na, one would expect it to be included in the steps of breath meditation and in the graphic analogies used to describe jh&#257;na, but it isn't. Some Theravadins insist that questioning the commentaries is a sign of disrespect for the tradition, but it seems to be a sign of greater disrespect for the Buddha &mdash; or the compilers of the Canon &mdash; to assume that he or they would have left out something absolutely essential to the practice.</p>

<p>So it would seem that what jh&#257;na means in the commentaries is something quite different from what it means in the Canon. Because of this difference we can say that the commentaries are right in viewing their type of jh&#257;na as unnecessary for Awakening, but Awakening cannot occur without the attainment of jh&#257;na in the canonical sense.</p>

<p>We have already given a sketch in the preceding section of how jh&#257;na in its canonical sense can act as the basis for transcendent discernment. To recapitulate: On attaining any of the first seven levels of jh&#257;na, one may step back slightly from the object of jh&#257;na &mdash; entering the fifth factor of noble right concentration [<a href='part3.html#passage-150'>&sect;150</a>] &mdash; to perceive how the mind relates to the object. In doing this, one sees the process of causation as it plays a role in bringing the mind to jh&#257;na, together with the various mental acts of fabrication that go into keeping it there [<a href='part3.html#passage-182'>&sect;182</a>]. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-172'>&sect;172</a> lists these acts in considerable detail. The fact that the passage emphasizes the amazing abilities of Sariputta, the Buddha's foremost disciple in terms of discernment, implies that there is no need for every meditator to perceive all these acts in such a detailed fashion. What is essential is that one develop a sense of dispassion for the state of jh&#257;na, seeing that even the relatively steady sense of refined pleasure and equanimity it provides is artificial and willed, inconstant and stressful [<a href='part3.html#passage-182'>&sect;182</a>], a state fabricated from many different events, and thus not worth identifying with.</p>

<p>Jhana thus becomes an ideal test case for understanding the workings of kamma and <a id='dependent1-3f'>dependent co-arising</a> in the mind. Its stability gives discernment a firm basis for seeing clearly; its refined sense of pleasure and equanimity allow the mind to realize that even the most refined mundane states involve the inconstancy and stress common to all willed phenomena. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-167'>&sect;167</a> lists a number of verbal mental acts surrounding the exercise of supranormal powers that can be regarded in a similar light, as topics to be analyzed so as to give rise to a sense of dispassion. The dispassion that results in either case enables one to experience the fading away and cessation of the last remaining activities in the mind, even the activity of discernment itself. When this process fully matures, it leads on to total relinquishment, resulting in the clear knowing and release of Arahantship.</p>

<p>In contrast to the issue of the role of jh&#257;na as a condition for discernment, the role of discernment as a condition for jh&#257;na is uncontroversial. Discernment aids jh&#257;na on two levels: mundane and transcendent. On the mundane level, it enables one to perceive the various factors that go into one's state of jh&#257;na so that one can master them and shed the factors that prevent one from attaining a higher level of jh&#257;na. This again involves the reflection that constitutes the fifth factor of <a id='nobleconc1-3f'>noble right concentration</a>, but in this case the results stay on the mundane level. For instance, as one masters the first level of jh&#257;na and can reflect on the elements of stress it contains, one may perceive that directed thought and evaluation should be abandoned because they have become unnecessary in maintaining one's concentration, just as the forms used in pouring a cement wall become unnecessary when the cement has hardened. In dropping these factors, one then goes on to the second level of jh&#257;na. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-175'>&sect;175</a> gives a list of the factors that, in succession, are dropped in this way as one attains higher and higher levels of concentration.</p>

<p>On the transcendent level, the discernment that precipitates Awakening results in a supramundane level of jh&#257;na called the fruit of gnosis, which is described in <a href='part3.html#passage-176'>&sect;&sect;176-77</a> &mdash; a type of jh&#257;na independent of all perceptions (mental labels) and intentional processes, beyond all limitations of cosmos, time, and the present: the Arahant's foretaste, in this lifetime, of the absolutely total Unbinding experienced by the awakened mind at death.</p>

<p>These four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world. Which four?</p>

<p>There is the case of the individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness, but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment.

<p>The individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness, but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, should approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment... and ask him: 'How should fabrications be regarded? How should they be investigated? How should they be seen with insight?' The other will answer in line with what he has seen &amp; experienced: 'Fabrications should be regarded in this way... investigated in this way... seen in this way with insight.' Then eventually he [the first] will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through heightened discernment.</p>

<p>As for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, but not internal tranquility of awareness, he should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness... and ask him, 'How should the mind be steadied? How should it be made to settle down? How should it be unified? How should it be concentrated?'

<p>[Similarly with the other levels of jh&#257;na up through the dimension of nothingness.]</p>

<p>Thus, as far as the perception-attainments go, that is as far as gnosis-penetration goes. As for these two dimensions &mdash; the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception &amp; the attainment of the cessation of feeling &amp; perception &mdash; I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators, skilled in attaining, skilled in attaining &amp; emerging, who have attained &amp; emerged in dependence on them.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-175">&sect; 175</a>.</b> <a id='sariputta175'>Ven. S&#257;riputta</a>: This Unbinding is pleasant, friends. This Unbinding is pleasant.</p>

<p><a id='udayin175'>Ud&#257;yin</a>: But what is the pleasure here, my friend, where there is nothing felt?</p>

<p>Ven. S&#257;riputta: Just that is the pleasure here, my friend: where there is nothing felt. There are these five strings of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing; sounds... smells... tastes... tactile sensations cognizable via the body &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. Whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality, that is sensual pleasure.</p>

<p>Now there is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jh&#257;na... If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality, that is an affliction for him. <a id='pain175'>Just as</a> pain arises as an affliction for a healthy person, even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an affliction for him. Now the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stress. So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the second jh&#257;na... If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with directed thought, that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the third jh&#257;na... If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with rapture, that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the fourth jh&#257;na... If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with equanimity, that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with form, that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of space, that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the dimension of nothingness. If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of nothingness, that is an affliction for him... whatever is an affliction is stress. So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk... enters &amp; remains in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling. And when he has seen with discernment, his effluents are completely ended. So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant.</p>

And how is an unbroken colt absorbed? An unbroken colt, tied to the feeding trough, is absorbed with the thought, 'Barley grain! Barley grain!' Why is that?

Tied to the feeding trough, he is simply absorbed with the thought, 'Barley grain! Barley grain!'</p>

<p>In the same way, there are cases where an unbroken colt of a man, having gone to the wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, dwells with his awareness overcome by sensual passion, obsessed with sensual passion. He does not discern the escape, as it has come to be, from sensual passion once it has arisen. Making that sensual passion the focal point, he absorbs himself with it, besorbs, resorbs, &amp; supersorbs himself with it.</p>

<p>He dwells with his awareness overcome by ill will... sloth &amp; drowsiness... restlessness &amp; anxiety... uncertainty, obsessed with uncertainty. He does not discern the escape, as it has come to be, from uncertainty once it has arisen.

<h1><a id='part3-g'>G. Equanimity in Concentration &amp; Discernment</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>

<p>We have pinpointed the fifth, reflective level of <a id='nobleconc1-3g'>noble right concentration</a> [<a href='part3.html#passage-150'>&sect;150</a>] as the mental state in which transcendent discernment can arise. A look at how equanimity functions in this process will help to flesh out our account of this state.</p>

<p>The word "equanimity" is used in the Canon in two basic senses: 1) a neutral feeling in the absence of pleasure and pain, and 2) an attitude of even-mindedness in the face of every sort of experience, regardless of whether pleasure and pain are present or not. The attitude of even-mindedness is what is meant here.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-179'>&sect;179</a> gives an outline of the place of equanimity in the emotional life of a person on the path of practice. This outline is interesting for several reasons. To begin with, contrary to many teachings currently popular in the West, it shows that there is a skillful use for the sense of distress that can come to a person who longs for the goal of the practice but has yet to attain it. This sense of distress can help one to get over the distress that comes when one feels deprived of pleasant sensory objects, for one realizes that the goal unattained is a much more serious lack than an unattained sensual pleasure. With one's priorities thus straightened out, one will turn one's energy to the pursuit of the path, rather than to the pursuit of sensual pleasure. As the path thus matures, it results in the sense of joy that comes on gaining an insight into the true nature of sensory objects &mdash; a joy that in turn matures into a sense of equanimity resulting from that very same insight. This is the highest stage of what is called equanimity "dependent on multiplicity" &mdash; i.e., equanimity in the face of multiple objects.</p>

<p>Passages <a href='part3.html#passage-180'>&sect;180</a> and <a href='part3.html#passage-181'>&sect;181</a> go into more detail on how to foster this sort of equanimity. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-181'>&sect;181</a> describes three stages in the process: 1) <i>development,</i> or a conscious turning of the mind to equanimity in the face of agreeable or disagreeable objects; 2) a state of <i>being in training,</i> in which one feels a spontaneous disillusionment with agreeable or disagreeable objects; and 3) <i>fully developed faculties,</i> in which one's even-mindedness is so completely mastered that one is in full control of one's thought processes in the face of agreeable or disagreeable objects. Because the first of these three stages is a conscious process, both <a href='part3.html#passage-180'>&sect;180</a> and <a href='part3.html#passage-181'>&sect;181</a> illustrate it with a series of graphic metaphors to help "tune" the mind to the right attitude and to help keep that attitude firmly in mind.</p>

<p>However, the cultivation of equanimity does not stop with equanimity dependent on multiplicity. Formless jh&#257;na, if one is able to attain it, functions as a basis for equanimity dependent on <a id='singleness1'>singleness</a> [<a href='part3.html#passage-179'>&sect;179</a>], i.e., the singleness of jh&#257;na. The next stage is to use this equanimity to bring on the state of equipoise called <a id='nonfash-3g'>non-fashioning</a> <i>(atammayata),</i> although <a href='part3.html#passage-183'>&sect;183</a> shows that non-fashioning can be attained directly from any of the stages of jh&#257;na, and not just the formless ones. Exactly what non-fashioning involves is shown in <a href='part3.html#passage-182'>&sect;182</a>: one perceives the fabricated and willed nature of even one's refined state of jh&#257;na, and becomes so dispassionate toward the whole process that one "neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or un-becoming." In this state of non-fashioning, the mind is so balanced that it contributes absolutely no present input into the conditioning of experience at all. Because the process of conditioned or fabricated experience, on the unawakened level, requires present input together with input from the past in order to continue functioning, the entire process then breaks down, and all that remains is the <a id='unfab-3g'>Unfabricated</a>.</p>

<p>After this experience, the processes of worldly experience resume due to the kammic input from the past, but one's attitude toward these processes is changed, in line with the mental fetters [<a href="part2.html#fetters">II/A</a>] that have been cut by the Awakening. If the Awakening was total, one continues to deal on an awakened level with the world until the time of one's total Unbinding with an attitude of perfect even-mindedness, illustrated by the three "frames of reference" described at the end of <a href='part3.html#passage-179'>&sect;179</a> [see also <a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>]. One feels sympathy for others and seeks their well-being, experiencing a sense of satisfaction when they respond to one's teachings, but otherwise one stays equanimous, untroubled, mindful, and alert. This passage shows that the even-mindedness of a fully awakened person is an attitude not of cold indifference, but rather of mental imperturbability. Such a person has found true happiness and would like others to share that happiness as well, but that happiness is not dependent on how others respond. This is the ideal state of mind for a person who truly works for the benefit of the world.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-179">&sect; 179</a>.</b> 'The thirty-six emotions should be known by experience.' Thus it was said. And in reference to what was it said? Six kinds of household joy &amp; six kinds of renunciation joy; six kinds of household distress &amp; six kinds of renunciation distress; six kinds of household equanimity &amp; six kinds of renunciation equanimity.</p>

<p>And what are the six kinds of household joy? The joy that arises when one regards as an acquisition the acquisition of forms cognizable by the eye &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, connected with worldly baits &mdash; or when one recalls the previous acquisition of such forms after they have passed, ceased, &amp; changed: that is called household joy. [Similarly with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, &amp; ideas.]</p>

<p>And what are the six kinds of renunciation joy? The joy that arises when &mdash; experiencing the inconstancy of those very forms, their change, fading, &amp; cessation &mdash; one sees with right discernment as it has come to be that all forms, past or present, are inconstant, stressful, subject to change: that is called renunciation joy. [Similarly with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, &amp; ideas.]</p>

<p>And what are the six kinds of household distress? The distress that arises when one regards as a non-acquisition the non-acquisition of forms cognizable by the eye &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, connected with worldly baits &mdash; or when one recalls the previous non-acquisition of such forms after they have passed, ceased, &amp; changed: that is called household distress. [Similarly with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, &amp; ideas.]</p>

<p>And what are the six kinds of renunciation distress? The distress coming from the longing that arises in one who is filled with longing for the unexcelled liberations when &mdash; experiencing the inconstancy of those very forms, their change, fading, &amp; cessation &mdash; he sees with right discernment as it has come to be that all forms, past or present, are inconstant, stressful, subject to change and he is filled with this longing: 'O when will I enter &amp; remain in the dimension that the noble ones now enter &amp; remain in?' This is called renunciation distress. [Similarly with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, &amp; ideas.]</p>

<p>And what are the six kinds of household equanimity? The equanimity that arises when a foolish, deluded person &mdash; a run-of-the-mill, untaught person who has not conquered his limitation or the results of action &amp; who is blind to danger &mdash; sees a form with the eye. Such equanimity does not go beyond the form, which is why it is called household equanimity. [Similarly with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, &amp; ideas.]</p>

<p>And what are the six kinds of renunciation equanimity? The equanimity that arises when &mdash; experiencing the inconstancy of those very forms, their change, fading, &amp; cessation &mdash; one sees with right discernment as it has come to be that all forms, past or present, are inconstant, stressful, subject to change: this equanimity goes beyond form, which is why it is called renunciation equanimity. [Similarly with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, &amp; ideas.]</p>

<p>'Thirty-six emotions should be known by experience.' Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>'With regard to them, depending on this, abandon that.' Thus it was said. And in reference to what was it said?</p>

<p>Here, by depending &amp; relying on the six kinds of renunciation joy, abandon &amp; transcend the six kinds of household joy. Such is their abandoning, such is their transcending. By depending &amp; relying on the six kinds of renunciation distress, abandon &amp; transcend the six kinds of household distress. Such is their abandoning, such is their transcending. By depending &amp; relying on the six kinds of renunciation equanimity, abandon &amp; transcend the six kinds of household equanimity. Such is their abandoning, such their transcending.</p>

<p>By depending &amp; relying on the six kinds of renunciation joy, abandon &amp; transcend the six kinds of renunciation distress. Such is their abandoning, such is their transcending. By depending &amp; relying on the six kinds of renunciation equanimity, abandon &amp; transcend the six kinds of renunciation joy. Such is their abandoning, such their transcending.</p>

<p>There is equanimity coming from multiplicity, dependent on multiplicity; and there is equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on singleness.</p>

<p>And what is equanimity coming from multiplicity, dependent on multiplicity? There is equanimity with regard to forms, equanimity with regard to sounds...smells...tastes...tactile sensations [&amp; ideas: this word appears in one of the recensions]. This is equanimity coming from multiplicity, dependent on multiplicity.</p>

<p>And what is equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on singleness? There is equanimity dependent on the dimension of the infinitude of space, equanimity dependent on the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness...the dimension of nothingness...the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on singleness.</p>

<p>By depending &amp; relying on equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on singleness, abandon &amp; transcend equanimity coming from multiplicity, dependent on multiplicity. Such is its abandoning, such its transcending.</p>

<p>By depending &amp; relying on <a id='nonfash179'>non-fashioning</a>, abandon &amp; transcend the equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on singleness. Such is its abandoning, such its transcending.</p>

<p>'Depending on this, abandon that.' Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>'There are three frames of reference (establishings of mindfulness) that a noble one cultivates, cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a group.' Thus it was said. And in reference to what was it said?</p>

<p>There is the case where the Teacher &mdash; out of sympathy, seeking their well-being &mdash; teaches the Dhamma to his disciples: 'This is for your well-being, this is for your happiness.' His disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosis. Turning aside, they stray from the Teacher's message. In this case the Tath&#257;gata is not satisfied nor is he sensitive to satisfaction, yet he remains untroubled, mindful, &amp; alert. This is the first frame of reference...</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the case where the Teacher &mdash; out of sympathy, seeking their well-being &mdash; teaches the Dhamma to his disciples: 'This is for your well-being, this is for your happiness.' Some of his disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosis. Turning aside, they stray from the Teacher's message. But some of his disciples listen, lend ear, &amp; apply their minds to gnosis. They do not turn aside or stray from the Teacher's message. In this case the Tath&#257;gata is not satisfied nor is he sensitive to satisfaction; at the same time he is not dissatisfied nor is he sensitive to dissatisfaction. Free from both satisfaction &amp; dissatisfaction, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert. This is the second frame of reference...</p>

<h1><a id='part3-h'>H. Discernment: Right View</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>The texts define right view as knowledge with regard to the four noble truths. The phrase "with regard to," here (expressed by the locative case in Pali), can also mean "in terms of," and this alternative meaning is especially relevant in this case. It reflects the point that the knowledge constituting right view is not a theoretical knowledge about the truths but is a way of using the truths to categorize all of conditioned experience. Because these truths view experience in terms of function &mdash; how unskillful and skillful mental qualities play a role in the causal chain of creating suffering or bringing it to an end [DN 1; <a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p63">MFU, p. 64</a>] &mdash; the right way to view right view itself is not to stop with its definition but to regard it in terms of its function and then put it to its intended use.</p>

<p>The function of right view is to look at events in the mind in a way that gives rise to a sense of dispassion, leading the mind to a state of <a id='nonfash1-3h'>non-fashioning</a> and then on to Awakening. It does this by focusing on the way in which passion and desire lead to suffering and stress. In this, it develops the mind's basic reaction to stress &mdash; the search for a way to escape from the stress [<a href='part3.html#passage-189'>&sect;189</a>] &mdash; in a skillful way so that this reaction actually leads to utter release. When the mind sees, without its normal bewilderment, the actual process by which stress is caused, it will naturally let go of the causes. When it sees passion clearly enough to catch that passion in the act of leading to stress, it will naturally develop a sense of dispassion for and detachment from the passion, so that it can view it simply as a mental event, with no meaning in terms of anything else. This opens the way to the state of non-fashioning where the cause of stress is allowed to cease.</p>

<p>The causal connection between passion and desire on the one hand, and stress on the other, is explained in the standard formula for <a id='dependent1-3h'>dependent co-arising</a> under the factor of clinging/sustenance. A passage in the Canon [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.121.than.html">SN 22.121</a>, <a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p44">MFU, pp. 44-45</a>] analyzes this factor into four forms of passion and desire for the five aggregates: clinging to sensuality, clinging to habits and practices, clinging to views, and clinging to theories about the self. The third form of clinging listed here points to one of the paradoxes about right view: it is a form of view that has to loosen attachment to all views, ultimately including itself. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-187'>&sect;187</a> shows how this happens. When faced with a variety of views about the world and the self, right view looks at the views, not in terms of their content, but simply as events in the mind, in and of themselves. It sees them as part of a causal chain: fabricated, inconstant, stressful, and thus not-self, not worthy of attachment. In this way it makes the mind dispassionate to all other views: dispassionate toward the terms they use, dispassionate toward their claims to truth. Right view then turns on itself to see itself as part of a similar causal chain. This loosens any sense of attachment even for right view so that the mind can see the view simply as an event: "there is this." This entry into the perceptual mode of emptiness leads straight to the "higher escape" &mdash; the state of non-fashioning &mdash; that then becomes present to awareness.</p>

<p>Because right view is the only form of view that contains the seeds of its own transcendence in this way, it is the only form of knowing that is skillful enough to lead to Awakening. The Canon gives no room for any alternative "skillful means" that would contradict right view. After the experience of Awakening, the texts tell us [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.122.than.html">SN 22.122</a>], one continues to make use of right view, with no sense of clinging, as a pleasant abiding for the mind and for mindfulness and alertness, much as one would use jh&#257;na for the same purpose [<a href="#part3-e">III/E</a>]. This process of transcending right view even as one makes use of it shows that non-attachment to views does not mean agnosticism or an openness to all views. Instead, non-attachment is a skillful way of making use of one's discerning faculties, seeing through to the causal function of all views, so that one may attain Awakening and then maintain a pleasant and mindfully alert abiding after one has become awakened.</p>

<p>The steps in the functioning of right view correspond to the three stages of frames-of-reference meditation [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>]. The first step, in which one focuses on events in and of themselves &mdash; and not in reference to anything they might mean outside of the range of immediate experience &mdash; corresponds to the <a id='firstframe-3h'>first stage</a> of frames-of-reference meditation, in which one stays focused on the body, etc., in and of itself, putting aside all greed and distress with reference to the world. The second step of right view, in which one focuses on events in terms of their role in the causal chain &mdash; fabricated, inconstant, stressful, and not-self &mdash; corresponds to the <a id='secondframe1-3h'>second stage</a> of frames-of-reference meditation, in which one remains focused on the phenomenon of origination and passing away. The third step of right view, in which one sees even right view simply as an event, corresponds to the <a id='threeframe1'>third stage</a> of frames-of-reference meditation in which one moves to the perceptual mode of "entry into emptiness," noting <a id='thereisthis'>simply, "There is this"</a> &mdash; without being caught up in the "this" &mdash; and from there on to non-fashioning and Awakening. Because the practice of jh&#257;na is also implicated in these three steps &mdash; steadying the mind in the first step, sensitizing it to causality in the second, and providing the basis for the fifth factor of noble concentration in the third &mdash; mindfulness, concentration, and discernment are thus inextricably intertwined as they develop along the path to Awakening.</p>

<p>It is important to note that right view functions in two time frames: small and large. Its primary frame is in the small frame, dealing exclusively with the immediate present. As it focuses on the phenomenon of origination and passing away, it reduces its terms of analysis to more and more basic levels until reaching the point where it sees even such simple categories as "being" and "non-being" as extraneous, inappropriate, and irrelevant to the simple flow of events arising and passing away in the present [<a href='part3.html#passage-186'>&sect;186</a>]. As a result, it strips everything down to the most basic categories of experience &mdash; the presence and absence of stress &mdash; without adding anything further. This <a id='phenom-3h'>phenomenological mode</a> of perception, or "entry into emptiness," sees things simply in terms of what is present and what is not [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.121.than.html">MN 121</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p83">MFU, pp. 82-85</a>]. Here, realizations are expressed merely as pointers to present phenomena without any content that would point to anything outside of direct experience: "There is this," [MN 102; <a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p82">MFU, pp. 81-82</a>] "Such is form, such is feeling," [<a href='part3.html#passage-149'>&sect;149</a>] etc. The Pali name for this/that conditionality, <i>idappaccayata,</i> points to the fact that not only the phenomena but also their relationships are a matter of immediate, "right here-and-now" insight.</p>

<p>Once these insights are gained on the level of radically immediate experience, one realizes that they have implications for the larger time frame of the whole process of transmigration and one's entire experience of the cosmos as well [<a href='part3.html#passage-211'>&sect;&sect;211-15</a>]. The process of stress arising and passing away in the present is precisely the same process as that of living beings arising and passing away on the cosmic scale. One sees that one has participated in this process from an inconceivable beginning in time; one knows &mdash; now that the process has been disbanded &mdash;  that one has found the end of the cycle of rebirth. This is because, in entering radically into the present moment by stripping away all clinging, one ultimately steps out of the dimensions of time and the present; having done so, one can see the totality of what it means to be in those dimensions.</p>

<p>This point is illustrated in two passages [<a href="part2.html#passage-74">&sect;&sect;74</a>, <a href="part2.html#passage-64">64</a>] that express the content of right view immediately before and after the experience of the Deathless:</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p>'From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on. The total fading &amp; cessation of ignorance, of this mass of darkness, is this peaceful, exquisite state: the resolution of all fabrications; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding.'
</p>

<p>'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are effluents... This is the origination of effluents... This is the cessation of effluents... This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the effluent of sensuality, released from the effluent of becoming, released from the effluent of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>
</div>

<p>The first passage depicts the act of discernment that verifies the principles of conviction. The second passage depicts the act of discernment that confirms the fact that the five faculties, when fully developed, do lead to the Deathless [<a href='part2.html#passage-89'>&sect;89</a>]. Notice that both passages follow a similar pattern, even though they deal with vastly different time scales. Transmigration and darkness, in the first passage, correspond to stress in the second. Ignorance and craving are the origination of stress, and the sentence, "The total fading &amp; cessation of ignorance... Unbinding," describes the cessation of stress. The act of discernment that sees all these things is the way leading to the cessation of stress.</p>

<p>This repetition of the same pattern on two different frames of space and time in non-linear systems is called <a id='scale-3h'>scale invariance</a>: the same process on two different scales [<a href="part1.html#scale1-1b">I/B</a>]. It is one of the most distinctive features of the Buddha's teachings, for it shows how an insight into a present moment in the mind can have repercussions on one's entire involvement in the cosmos. The principle behind the scale invariance of right view is this/that conditionality: the fact that one's continued participation in the cosmos is kept going by one's present contribution to the causal stream initiated over the long course of the past. By reaching the state of <a id='nonfash3-3h'>non-fashioning</a>, one stops contributing to the present, and thus can bring the totality of one's participation to an end, leaving the utter freedom of Unbinding. In this sense, the principle of this/that conditionality explains the possibility of attaining the Deathless, while the actuality of the Deathless &mdash; once it is attained through skillful mastery of kamma &mdash; is what proves the principle of this/that conditionality as an adequate description of the causal process that fabricates conditioned experience and provides an opening to the <a id='unfab-3h'>Unfabricated</a>.</p>

<p>When this had been said, the wanderers said to An&#257;thapi&#7751;&#7693;ika the householder, 'We have each &amp; every one expounded to you in line with our own positions. Now tell us what views you have.'</p>

<p>'Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not mine, is not what I am, is not my self. This is the sort of view I have.'</p>

<p>'So, householder, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. You thus adhere to that very stress, submit yourself to that very stress.'</p>

<p>'Venerable sirs, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not mine, is not what I am, is not my self. Having seen this well with right discernment as it has come to be, I also discern the higher escape from it as it has come to be.'</p>

<p>When this had been said, the wanderers fell silent, abashed, sitting with their shoulders drooping, their heads down, brooding, at a loss for words. An&#257;thapi&#7751;&#7693;ika the householder, perceiving that the wanderers were silent, abashed...at a loss for words, got up &amp; left.</p>

<h1><a id='part3-h-1'>H (i). Discernment: The Four Noble Truths</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>In <a href='part3.html#passage-139'>&sect;139</a>, the Buddha refers to himself as a doctor, treating the spiritual illnesses of his students. This metaphor is useful to keep in mind as we discuss the basic categories of right view: the four noble truths. Many people have charged Buddhism with being pessimistic because the four truths start out with stress and suffering, but this charge misses the fact that the first truth is part of a strategy of diagnosis and therapy focusing on the basic problem in life so as to offer a solution to it. This is the sense in which the Buddha was like a doctor, focusing on the disease he wanted to cure. The total cure he promised as a result of his course of therapy shows that, in actuality, he was much less pessimistic than the vast majority of world, for whom wisdom means accepting the bad things in life with the good, assuming that there is no chance in this life for unalloyed happiness. The Buddha was an extremely demanding person, unwilling to bend to this supposed wisdom or to rest with anything less than absolute happiness. We are fortunate that he was so demanding and succeeded in his aim, for otherwise we would have to undertake the uncertain task of trying to discover the way to that happiness ourselves.</p>

<p>Although the four noble truths constitute the most basic categories of the Buddha's teaching, he did not discuss them unless he felt that his listeners were ready for them. To understand and accept them requires a basic shift in the framework of one's awareness, and only a mind that has been thoroughly prepared is in a position to make such a shift. Often the Buddha would prepare his listeners with what he called a gradual discourse: discussing step by step the joy of <a id='dana1-3h1'>generosity</a>; the joy of living a virtuous life; the long-term sensory rewards of generosity and <a id='virtue-3h1'>virtue</a> in <a id='loka-3h1'>heaven</a>; the drawbacks and impermanence of sensory pleasures and conditioned phenomena in general; and finally the rewards of renunciation. Then, if he sensed that his listeners were ready to look favorably on renunciation as a means to true happiness, he would discuss the four truths, beginning with suffering and stress. In this, he followed the sequence of his own Awakening: beginning with insight into the punishments of bad kamma, the rewards of good kamma, and the limitations of all kamma, and then proceeding to insight into the origination of stress and its cessation through the cessation of kamma [<a href='part1.html#passage-9'>&sect;9</a>].</p>

<p>Once the problem of stress and suffering is solved, he said, there are no more problems. This is why he limited his teaching to this issue, even though his own Awakening encompassed much more [<a href='part3.html#passage-188'>&sect;188</a>]. The vicious cycle that operates between suffering and ignorance &mdash; with ignorance underlying the craving that causes suffering, and suffering causing the bewilderment that leads people to act in ignorant and unskillful ways [<a href='part3.html#passage-189'>&sect;189</a>] &mdash; can be broken only when one focuses on understanding suffering and stress and the causal network that surrounds them. Most people are so bewildered by the complexities of suffering and stress that they do not even know what the true problem is. Thus they may deny that they are suffering, or may imagine that something stressful can actually be a solution to their problems. The genius of the Buddha is that he recognized the most elegant and comprehensive way to deal with every variety of dissatisfaction in life. When suffering and stress are seen with clear knowledge, they no longer can cause bewilderment, and the cycle that underlies all the problems of experience can be disbanded for good.</p>

<p>As <a href='part3.html#passage-195'>&sect;195</a> states, this clear knowledge is based on knowledge of the four noble truths. These truths are best understood not as the content of a belief, but as categories for viewing and classifying the processes of immediate experience. In <a href='part2.html#passage-51'>&sect;51</a>, the Buddha refers to them as categories of "<a id='yoniso1-3h1'>appropriate attention</a>," a skillful alternative to the common way that people categorize their experience in terms of two dichotomies: being/non-being, and self/other. For several reasons, these common dichotomies are actually problem-causing, rather than problem-solving. <a id='badq-3h1'>The being/non-being dichotomy</a>, for instance, comes down to the question of whether or not there exist actual "things" behind the changing phenomena of experience. This type of questioning deals, by definition, with possibilities that cannot be directly experienced. If the things in question could be experienced, then they wouldn't be lying behind experience. Thus the being/non-being dichotomy pulls one's attention into the land of conjecture &mdash; "a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views" [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html">MN 72</a>] &mdash; and away from the area of direct awareness where the real problem and its solution lie [<a href='part3.html#passage-186'>&sect;186</a>].</p>

<p>As for the self/other dichotomy, there is the initial difficulty of determining what the self is. Any true self would have to lie totally under one's own control, and yet nothing that one might try to identify as one's self actually meets this criterion. Although the sense of self may seem intuitive enough, when carefully examined it shows itself to be based on confused perceptions and ideas. If one's basic categories for understanding experience are a cause for confusion in this way, they can lead only to confused, unskillful action, and thus to more suffering and stress. For example, when people view the source of their problems as poor relationships between themselves and others, or inadequate integration of the self, they are trying to analyze their problems in terms of categories that are ultimately uncertain. Thus there is a built-in uncertainty in the efforts they make to solve their problems in terms of those categories.</p>

<p>A second problem, no matter how one might define a self, is the question of how to prove whether or not it actually exists. This question entangles the mind in the unresolvable problems of the being/non-being dichotomy mentioned above: because the problem is phrased in terms that cannot be directly experienced, it forces the solution into a realm that cannot be experienced, either. This fact probably explains the Buddha's statement in <a href='part3.html#passage-230'>&sect;230</a> to the effect that if one even asks the question of whether there is someone standing outside the processes of <a id='dependent-3h1'>dependent co-arising</a> to whom those processes pertain, it is impossible to lead the life that will bring about an end to suffering. Regardless of whether one would answer the question with a yes or a no, the terms of the question focus on an area outside of direct experience and thus away from the true problem &mdash; the direct experience of suffering &mdash; and actually make it worse. If one assumes the existence of a self, one must take on the implicit imperative to maximize the self's well-being through recourse to the "other." This recourse may involve either exploiting the "other" or swallowing the "other" into the self by equating one's self with the cosmos as a whole. Either approach involves clinging and craving, which lead to further suffering and stress. On the other hand, if one denies any kind of self, saying that the cosmos is totally "other," then one is assuming that there is nothing with any long-term existence whose happiness deserves anything more than quick, short-term attempts at finding pleasure. The imperative in this case would be to pursue immediate pleasure with as little effort as possible, thus aborting any sustained effort to bring about an end to suffering.</p>

<p>These problems explain why the Buddha regarded questions of existence and non-existence, self and no-self, as unskillful, inappropriate ways of attending to experience.</p>

<p>Stress and its cessation, on the other hand, are categories that avoid these problems. To begin with, they are immediately present and apparent. Even babies recognize stress and pain, well before they have any concept of "self" or "being." If one pays close attention to one's actual experience, there is no question about whether or not stress and its cessation are present. Finally, because these categories don't require fashioning notions of "self" or "other" &mdash; or "no-self" or "no-other" &mdash; on top of one's immediate awareness [&sect;&sect;<a href='part3.html#passage-228'>228-230</a>], they allow one to reach the mode of "<a id='threeframe1-3h1'>entry into emptiness</a>" on the verge of non-fashioning, in which, as we mentioned in <a href='#thereisthis'>III/H</a>, the mind simply notes, "There is this..." Thus they are ideal categories for analyzing experience in a way that (1) reduces the confusion that causes people to act in unskillful ways and (2) brings the mind to a point where it can disengage and transcend all suffering and stress by ending the mental fabrication that provides input into the causal web.</p>

<p>As for the imperatives implicit in the four categories of the noble truths, they are very different from the imperatives implicit in the notion that there is a self or that there isn't. Stress, the first category, should be comprehended. In practice, this means admitting its presence, recognizing it as a problem, and then observing it with patient mindfulness to understand its true nature. One comes to realize that the problem is not with the stress and discomfort of external conditions, but with the stress and discomfort in the mind. One also sees how stress is part of a causal process, and that it is always accompanied by craving, its point of origination.</p>

<p>The second category &mdash; craving, the origination of stress &mdash; should be abandoned. Here we must note that the word "craving" covers not all desire, but only the desire leading to further becoming. The desire to escape from that becoming, as we have noted [<a href="part2.html#desire1-2d">II/D</a>], is part of the path. Without such a desire, no one would have the motivation to follow the path or reach Unbinding. When Unbinding is reached, though, even this desire is abandoned, just as a desire to walk to a park is abandoned on arriving there [<a href='part2.html#passage-67'>&sect;67</a>].</p>

<p>The third category, the cessation of stress, should be realized. The definition of this truth as the abandoning of craving means that it denotes the successful performance of the duty appropriate to the second noble truth. This introduces a double tier into the practice, in that one must not only abandon craving but also realize what is happening and what is uncovered in the process of that abandoning. This, in turn, accounts for two of the major themes covered so far in this book: the switch from "object" (craving) to "approach" (abandoning) as the focal point in one's meditation as one moves from the first to the second stage in frames-of-reference meditation [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>]; and the need for sensitivity to one's present input into the causal network in order to nurture the mind's skillful mastery of <a id='ida-3h1'>this/that conditionality</a> [<a href="part1.html#ida-1a">I/A</a>]. The <a id='floop-3h1'>feedback loop</a> created by this combination of abandoning and knowing is what eventually short-circuits the process of this/that conditionality, <a id='dependent2-3h1'>cutting dependent co-arising</a> at the links of craving and ignorance, and leading on to the state of non-fashioning that forms the threshold to the Deathless.</p>

<p>The fourth category, the way to the cessation of stress, is defined as the noble eightfold path, which we have already discussed in detail [<a href="part2.html#part2-h">II/H</a>]. This truth must be developed, which involves two processes: nurturing the conditions for clear knowing; and abstaining from acts of body, speech, and mind that involve craving and would obstruct knowledge. These two processes correspond to the two layers we have just noted in the duties associated with the cessation of stress: realizing and abandoning. This correspondence shows the intimate relation between the third and fourth noble truths, and explains the Buddha's insistence that the noble eightfold path is the only way to the goal.</p>

<p>Taken together, the four categories of the noble truths, along with their imperatives, follow a basic problem-solving approach: one solves the problem of stress by following a path of practice that directly attacks the cause of the problem. The noble eightfold path develops the qualities of mind needed to see that all the possible objects of craving &mdash; the five aggregates &mdash; are stressful, inconstant, and <a id='notself1-3h1'>not-self</a>. As a result, one grows dispassionate toward them. With nothing left to focus on, craving disbands. When one experiences the "remainderless fading &amp; cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, &amp; letting go of that very craving" [<a href='part3.html#passage-210'>&sect;210</a>], the problem is solved.</p>

<p>Although the texts list four separate duties appropriate to each of the truths, in actual practice these duties are four aspects of a single process. When stress is comprehended, the second noble truth &mdash; craving &mdash; has no object to latch onto and so can be abandoned. The full realization of what is happening in the process of that abandoning constitutes the realization of the third noble truth, the cessation of stress. Both the abandoning and the realization are accomplished by developing the path, which destroys any trace of ignorance concerning the four noble truths at the same time that it abandons craving. This is how the practice cuts the chain of dependent co-arising simultaneously at its two most crucial factors [<a href='part3.html#passage-210'>&sect;&sect;210-211</a>], thus unraveling the causal chain and opening the way for an experience of the <a id='unfab-3h1'>Unfabricated</a>.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-195'>&sect;195</a> lists three steps in this process, which take the form of three levels of knowledge concerning each of the four truths: recognizing the truth for what it is, recognizing the duty appropriate to the truth, and realizing that the duty has been completed. These levels of knowledge correspond to the three stages in right view that we mentioned in the preceding section. The first level corresponds to the stage of seeing events in and of themselves for what they actually are. The relationship between the second level of knowledge &mdash; realizing the duty appropriate to the truth &mdash; and the second stage of right view &mdash; viewing things as part of a causal chain &mdash; is somewhat less obvious, but more revealing once it is understood. The word "duty" makes the point that, in order to understand the process of origination and passing away, one must become involved in the process in an active way. This understanding does not come from a passive state of simply watching things arise and disappear. Instead, one must participate in the process, becoming sensitive to pre-existing causal conditions and the impact of one's present activity on those conditions, if one wants truly to understand them. The only way to know a causal relationship is to tamper with it and see what happens as a result. The more precise and skillful one's tampering, and the more properly attuned one's powers of observation, the more precise the knowledge that can be gained.</p>

<p>This active participation corresponds to the <a id='secondframe-3h1'>second stage</a> of frames of reference meditation [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>] and the process of gaining mastery in the practice of concentration [<a href="#part3-e">III/E</a>]. Ultimately, it comes down to the issues of acquiring skillfulness and understanding the connection between skillfulness and <a id='ida2-3h1'>this/that conditionality</a>. The meditator can gain escape from the confines of the causal process, not by simply watching it, but by developing the sensitivity to causal factors that comes from learning how to explore and manipulate them with skill.</p>

<p>The third level of knowledge &mdash; that the duty appropriate to the truth has been completed &mdash; corresponds to the mode of "<a id='thirdframe-3h1'>entry into emptiness</a>" on the verge of non-fashioning, when one realizes that <a id='present-3h1'>nothing more</a> needs to be contributed to the present moment. In fact, nothing more <i>can</i> be contributed to the present moment. As noted in the preceding section, this is the point where right view transcends itself. In terms of the four noble truths, this is where simple distinctions among the four truths begin to break down. As a modern teacher has put it, the meditator sees that all four truths are ultimately identical. After having used jh&#257;na and discernment, which form the heart of the path, to gain understanding of pain and to abandon clinging and craving, one comes to see that even jh&#257;na and discernment are composed of the same aggregates as stress and pain [<a href='part3.html#passage-173'>&sect;173</a>], and that one's attitude toward them involves subtle levels of clinging and craving as well.</p>

<p>Thus the path is simply a refined version of the first three noble truths, in which one has taken suffering, craving, and ignorance, and turned them into tools for pleasure, detachment, and insight. Without these tools, one could not have begun the process of release. Were it not for one's attachment to jh&#257;na and discernment, one could not have liberated oneself from the more obvious levels of stress; one could not have developed the sensitivity enabling one to appreciate the value of cessation and release when they finally come. Now, however, that these tools have performed their functions, they become the last remaining obstacle to full release. The approach to the problem of stress has now become, in and of itself, the only problem left. As the four truths become one in this way, their respective duties reach the point where any further activity would mean that they would cancel one another out. <a id='nonfash1-3h1'>This is where</a> the mind attains the state of non-fashioning, as there is nothing more it can do or know in terms of any of these duties. This lack of input into the present moment forms a breach in this/that conditionality, opening the way beyond the four truths and on to the Unfabricated.</p>

<p>This coalescing of the truths coincides with a movement noted earlier [<a href="part2.html#part2-h">II/H</a>], in which jh&#257;na and discernment become one and the same thing. This union of jh&#257;na and discernment solves the riddle of how one can come to know the end of the intention that keeps the round of rebirth in motion. As the path nears its end, the intentional activity underlying jh&#257;na becomes the sole remaining element of intention in the mind; while the <a id='yoniso2-3h1'>activity of discernment</a>, as appropriate attention aimed at understanding jh&#257;na, becomes the sole function of knowledge. As they reach culmination and coalesce, the attention focused on the intention and the intention behind the act of attention short-circuit one another. All that can follow on this point is the state of non-fashioning, in which all present input into the cycle of rebirth ends, and all experience of the cycle falls away. As we explained in the Introduction, the experience of this falling away at Awakening confirms not only the Buddha's teachings on the present function of kammic input in this/that conditionality, but also on the functioning of kamma in the round of rebirth in the larger dimensions of time.</p>

<p><a id='wheel-3h1'>The wheel</a>, the traditional symbol of the Dhamma, expresses these points in a visual form. The Buddha states [<a href='part3.html#passage-195'>&sect;195</a>] that when he gained full knowledge of all four truths on all three levels &mdash; recognizing the truth, recognizing the duty appropriate to it, and realizing that he had fully completed that duty &mdash; he knew that he had attained full Awakening. He elaborates on his assertion by setting out a table of two sets of variables &mdash; the four noble truths and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each &mdash; listing all twelve permutations of the two sets. This sort of table, in Indian legal and philosophical traditions, is called a wheel. This is why the discourse in which he makes this statement is called "Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion," and why the wheel used as a symbol of the Dhamma has twelve spokes, uniting at the hub, symbolizing the twelve permutations that merge into a singularity &mdash; knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be &mdash; at the still point of non-fashioning in the midst of the cycle of kamma.</p>

<p>'In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are more numerous (than what I have taught). And why haven't I taught them? Because they are not connected with the goal, do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That is why I have not taught them.</p>

And in reference to what was it said?</p>

<p>Birth is stress, aging is stress, death is stress; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stress; association with the unbeloved is stress; separation from the loved is stress; not getting what is wanted is stress. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stress.</p>

<p>And what is the cause by which stress comes into play? Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play.</p>

<p>And what is the diversity in stress? There is major stress &amp; minor, slowly fading &amp; quickly fading. This is called the diversity in stress.</p>

<p>And what is the result of stress? There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, &amp; becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?' I tell you, monks, that stress results either in bewilderment or in search.</p>

<p>And what is the cessation of stress? From the cessation of craving is the cessation of stress; and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

<p>Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns stress in this way, the cause by which stress comes into play in this way, the diversity of stress in this way, the result of stress in this way, the cessation of stress in this way, &amp; the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of stress.</p>

<p>'Stress should be known. The cause by which stress comes into play...The diversity in stress...The result of stress...The cessation of stress...The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known.' Thus it was said, and in reference to this was it said.</p>

<h1><a id='part3-h-2'>H (ii). Discernment: The First Truth</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>The first noble truth is that of <i>dukkha,</i> translated here as stress and suffering. The term has a wide range of other meanings as well, including distress, dis-ease, and &mdash; what is probably its most elemental meaning &mdash; pain. People learn their most basic strategies for dealing with pain in very early childhood, when their powers of observation are undeveloped and they cannot learn from the verbal lessons of others. Being in such a stage, they are in a poor position to understand pain, and it often leaves them bewildered. This means that they develop unskillful ways of handling it. Even when their minds later develop verbal and higher logical skills, many of the unskillful strategies and attitudes toward pain that they developed in early childhood persist on a subconscious level.</p>

<p>One of the most important insights leading up to the Buddha's Awakening was his realization that the act of comprehending pain lay at the essence of the spiritual quest. In trying to comprehend pain &mdash; instead of simply trying to get rid of it in line with one's habitual tendencies &mdash; one learns many valuable lessons. To begin with, one can end any sense of bewilderment in the face of pain. In seeing pain for what it truly is, one can treat it more effectively and skillfully, thus weakening the process by which pain and ignorance feed on each other. At the same time, as one learns to resist one's habitual reactions to pain, one begins to delve into the non-verbal, subconscious levels of the mind, bringing to light many ill-formed and hidden processes of which one was previously unaware. In this sense, pain is like a watering hole where all the animals in the forest &mdash; all the mind's subconscious tendencies &mdash; will eventually come to drink. Just as a naturalist who wants to make a survey of the wildlife in a particular area can simply station himself near a watering hole to wait for the animals that will eventually have to come there for water; in the same way, a meditator who wants to understand the mind can simply keep watch right at pain in order to see what subconscious reactions will appear. Thus the act of trying to comprehend pain leads not only to an improved understanding of pain itself, but also to an increased awareness of the most basic processes at work in the mind. As one sees how any lack of skill in these processes, and in particular in one's reactions to pain, leads only to more pain, one's mind opens to the possibility that more skillful reactions will not only alleviate specific pains but also lead away from pain altogether. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-238'>&sect;238</a> shows how <a id='convict1-3h2'>conviction</a> in this possibility &mdash; which is nothing other than the principle of kamma &mdash; leads from the experience of stress and pain into a causal chain that cuts the bewilderment leading to further pain and ends in total release.</p>

<p>Although pain is the best vantage point for observing the processes of the mind, it is also the most difficult, simply because it is so unpleasant and hard to bear. This is why discernment needs the faculties of conviction, persistence, mindfulness, and concentration to give it the detached assurance and steady focus needed to stick with pain in and of itself, in the phenomenological mode, and not veer off into the usual narratives, abstract theories, and other unskillful defenses the mind devises against the pain. Only through the development of the five faculties into right concentration does discernment have the basis of pleasure and equanimity needed to probe into pain without feeling threatened by it, thus enabling it to arrive at an unbiased understanding of its true nature.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-198'>&sect;198</a> shows the direction this understanding should take, ultimately analyzing the wide variety of stress and pain down to five categories: the five clinging-aggregates. Many of the remaining passages in this section give more detailed analysis of these categories. Taken together, these passages provide a useful conceptual framework for taking on the duty of trying to comprehend the issues surrounding stress, suffering, and pain. Here we will first discuss the aggregates, and then their connection with clinging and sustenance.</p>

<p>The five aggregates are form, feeling, perception, fabrications, and consciousness. These five categories cover the entire range of experience that can be adequately described [<a href='part3.html#passage-231'>&sect;231</a>]. "Form" covers all physical phenomena, both within one's own body and without. The remaining four categories cover all mental events. "Feeling" covers feelings of pleasure, pain, and neither-pleasure-nor-pain, regardless of whether they are based on physical or mental sensations. "Perception" denotes the mental act of applying labels or names to physical or mental events. "Fabrications" here covers the verbal and mental processes of concocting thoughts, questions, urges, or intentions in the mind. "<a id='consc-3h2'>Consciousness</a>" covers the act of consciousness at any of the six senses: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intellect. A few texts [<a href='part3.html#passage-235'>&sect;&sect;235-36</a>] discuss a <a id='unfab-3h2'>separate type of consciousness</a> that does not partake of any of the six senses or their objects. This type of consciousness is said to lie beyond the range of describable experience and so is not included under the five aggregates. In fact, it is equivalent to the Unfabricated and forms the goal at the end of the path.</p>

<p>The five aggregates, on their own, do not constitute suffering or stress. They are stressful only when functioning as objects of clinging/sustenance. This hybrid word &mdash; clinging/sustenance &mdash; is a translation of the Pali term<i> upadana. Upadana</i> has a hybrid meaning because it is used to cover two sides of a physical process metaphorically applied to the mind: the act of clinging whereby a <a id='fire-3h2'>fire</a> takes sustenance from a piece of fuel, together with the sustenance offered by the fuel. On the level of the mind, <i>upadana</i> denotes both the act of clinging and the object clung to, which together give sustenance to the process whereby mental pain arises. In terms of this metaphor, pain is hot and unstable like fire, whereas the mental act of clinging to any of the five aggregates is what keeps the fire burning. These images are part fiof a larger complex of imagery contained in the Pali discourses, likening the processes of pain and its cessation to the physical processes of fire and its extinguishing. An understanding of this imagery helps to give a graphic, intuitive sense for the ways in which the Pali texts analyze the problem of stress and pain.</p>

<p>Many of the texts explicitly liken pain to a fever or to a burning, unstable fire [<a href='part3.html#passage-221'>&sect;221</a>; Thig 8:1]. Others deal more in indirect imagery, in which the terminology for explaining fire is applied to the mind. The word <i>upadana</i> is one instance of this type of indirect imagery. Others include<i> khandha,</i> or aggregate, which also means the trunk of a tree; and <i>nibbana,</i> the most common name for the Buddhist goal, which also means the extinguishing of a fire. According to the physics of the Buddha's time, fire was "seized" when it was ignited. Burning, it was in a state of unstable agitation, entrapped by the fuel to which it clung for sustenance. On going out, it was "freed." Letting go of its sustenance, it grew cool, calm, and unbound. According to the <a id='comment1-3h2'>commentaries</a>, "unbound" is what <i>nibbana</i> literally means. Thus the study of pain is like the study of a raging fire: one tries to comprehend it in order to find the source of the burning, bondage, and entrapment so as to put the fire out and gain freedom from it for good.</p>

<p>There are four types of clinging to the aggregates that give sustenance to the processes of suffering and stress: desire and passion for</p>

<ul>
<li>the <i>sensuality</i> found in the aggregates,</li>
<li><i>views</i> regarding the aggregates,</li>
<li><i>practices and precepts</i> involving the aggregates, and</li>
<li><i>theories about the self</i> involving the aggregates.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.044.than.html">MN 44</a> [<a href="../likefire/2-3.html#p44">MFU, pp. 44-45</a>] makes the point that the act of clinging is neither the same as the aggregates nor entirely separate from them. If clinging were identical with the aggregates, there would be no way to experience the aggregates without clinging, and thus there would be no way for an awakened person to return to the conditioned level of experience after Awakening. If clinging and the aggregates were totally separate, clinging could exist independently of the aggregates and would count as a separate part of describable experience. If this were so, the transcending of the aggregates at the moment of Awakening would not constitute the transcending of the <a id='fabric-3h2'>fabricated realm</a>, and thus the task of comprehending suffering would not yet be finished. Thus the nature of the actual interdependence between clinging and the aggregates means that a full comprehension of the aggregates is enough to bring about Awakening, at the same time that it leaves an opening for the continued experience of the fabricated realm after Awakening has occurred.</p>

<p>What this interdependence means in practical terms is that one must examine the aggregates in such a way as to realize fully that they are not worth clinging to. One does this by focusing on two of their common characteristics: their instability and their complexity. In seeing their inherent instability, one realizes that they are inconstant. Because they are inconstant, any attempt to base happiness on them is inherently stressful, just as there is inherent stress in trying to sit comfortably on a wobbling chair. Because the aggregates offer no basis for true happiness, they lie beyond one's control and thus do not deserve to be viewed as "me" or "mine."</p>

<p>Focusing further on the aggregates, one perceives the complexity of their interrelationships. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-201'>&sect;201</a> indicates some of this complexity in its discussion of the relationship among feeling, perception, and sensory consciousness. Although these aggregates function in different ways, in actual experience they can occur only as parts of an interrelated cluster of mental events surrounding a common object. In fact, they are so closely related to one another that ordinary awareness assumes them to be a single whole. One of the tasks of discernment in comprehending pain is to see these aggregates as interrelated events. Because their interrelationships follow complex, invariable laws, one's comprehension of their true behavior brings with it the oppressive realization &mdash; oppressive as long as one is still regarding the causal network in part or in whole in terms of "self" or "other" &mdash; that they ultimately do not lie under one's control. At best, one can explore and manipulate them to the extent of understanding them to gain freedom from them, but in and of themselves they do not offer any stable kind of happiness.</p>

<p>Observing and understanding the complex interrelationships among feeling, perception, and consciousness leads one into the area of <a id='dependent1-3h2'>dependent co-arising</a>, which forms the essence of the second truth. As one's understanding grows more sensitive, it drives home the point that all clinging to these interrelated phenomena should be abandoned. This understanding &mdash; that phenomena taking part in such relationships are unworthy of clinging &mdash; forms the essence of the path. The full pursuit of this path, in which one abandons all passion and desire for the five aggregates, brings about knowledge of the cessation of stress. All of this bears out Ven. Gavampati's comment [<a href='part3.html#passage-194'>&sect;194</a>] that knowledge of the first noble truth inherently involves knowledge of the remaining three.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-198">&sect; 198</a>.</b> Now what, monks, is the noble truth of stress? Birth is stress, aging is stress, death is stress; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stress; association with the unbeloved is stress; separation from the loved is stress; not getting what is wanted is stress. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stress.</p>

<p>Now what is birth? Whatever birth, taking birth, descent, coming- to-be, coming-forth, appearance of aggregates, &amp; acquisition of (sense) media of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called birth.</p>

<p>And what is aging? Whatever aging, decrepitude, brokenness, graying, wrinkling, decline of life-force, weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called aging.</p>

<p>And what is death? Whatever deceasing, passing away, breaking up, disappearance, dying, death, completion of time, break up of the aggregates, casting off of the body, interruption in the life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called death.</p>

<p>And what is sorrow? Whatever sorrow, sorrowing, sadness, inward sorrow, inward sadness of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that is called sorrow.</p>

<p>And what is lamentation? Whatever crying, grieving, lamenting, weeping, wailing, lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that is called lamentation.</p>

<p>And what is pain? Whatever is experienced as bodily pain, bodily discomfort, pain or discomfort born of bodily contact, that is called pain.</p>

<p>And what is distress? Whatever is experienced as mental pain, mental discomfort, pain or discomfort born of mental contact, that is called distress.</p>

<p>And what is despair? Whatever despair, despondency, desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that is called despair.</p>

<p>And what is the stress of association with the unbeloved? There is the case where undesirable, unpleasing, unattractive sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, or tactile sensations occur to one; or one has connection, contact, relationship, interaction with those who wish one ill, who wish for one's harm, who wish for one's discomfort, who wish one no security from bondage. This is called the stress of association with the unbeloved.</p>

<p>And what is the stress of separation from the loved? There is the case where desirable, pleasing, attractive sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, or tactile sensations do not occur to one; or one has no connection, no contact, no relationship, no interaction with those who wish one well, who wish for one's benefit, who wish for one's comfort, who wish one security from bondage, nor with one's mother, father, brother, sister, friends, companions, or relatives. This is called the stress of separation from the loved.</p>

<p>And what is the stress of not getting what is wanted? In beings subject to birth, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to birth, and may birth not come to us.' But this is not to be achieved by wishing. This is the stress of not getting what is wanted. In beings subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair, and may aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair not come to us.' But this is not to be achieved by wishing. This is the stress of not getting what is wanted.</p>

<p>And what are the five clinging-aggregates that, in short, are stress? The form clinging-aggregate, the feeling clinging-aggregate, the perception clinging-aggregate, the fabrication clinging-aggregate, the consciousness clinging-aggregate: These are called the five clinging-aggregates that, in short, are stress.</p>

<p>There comes a time when the external fire property is provoked and consumes village, town &amp; city, countryside &amp; rural area, and then, coming to the edge of a green district, the edge of a road, the edge of a rocky district, to the water's edge, or to a lush, well-watered area, it goes out from lack of sustenance. There comes a time when people try to make [lit. 'search for'] fire even with a wing bone &amp; tendon parings. So when even in the external fire property &mdash; so vast &mdash; inconstancy will be discerned... then what of this short-lasting body, sustained by clinging, is 'I' or 'mine' or 'what I am'? It has here only a 'no'...</p>

<p>There comes a time when the external wind property is provoked, and carries off village, town &amp; city, countryside &amp; rural area. There comes a time when, in the last month of the hot season, they make ('search for') wind with a fan or a bellows, and even the grasses hanging in the drip-fringe of the thatch do not stir. So when even in the external wind property &mdash; so vast &mdash; inconstancy will be discerned, destructibility will be discerned, a tendency to decay will be discerned, changeability will be discerned, then what of this short-lasting body, sustained by clinging, is 'I' or 'mine' or 'what I am'? It has here only a 'no'...</p>

<h1><a id='part3-h-3'>H (iii). Discernment: The Second &amp; Third Truths</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>As noted under <a href="#part3-h-1">III/H/i</a>, the third noble truth is identical with the successful performance of the duty appropriate to the second. Thus these two truths are best discussed together.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-210'>&sect;210</a> gives the short definition of the second noble truth:</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p>Now what is the noble truth of the origination of stress? The craving that makes for further becoming &mdash; accompanied by passion &amp; delight, relishing now here &amp; now there &mdash; i.e., craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.</p>
</div>

<p>Craving for sensuality, here, means the desire for sensual objects. Craving for becoming means the desire for the formation of states or realms of being that are not currently happening, while craving for non-becoming means the desire for the destruction or halting of any that are. "Passion and delight," here, is apparently a synonym for the "desire and passion" for the five aggregates that constitutes clinging/sustenance  [<a href="#part3-h-2">III/H/ii</a>].</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-210'>&sect;210</a> also gives the short definition of the third noble truth:</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p>And what is the noble truth of the cessation of stress? The remainderless fading &amp; cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, &amp; letting go of that very craving.</p>
</div>

<p>The extended passages that make up the remainder of <a href='part3.html#passage-210'>&sect;210</a> make the point that craving must be brought to cessation right at the objects where it arises, i.e., by realizing that those objects are unworthy of craving.</p>

<p>The longer definitions of the second and third noble truths center on <a id='dependent1-3h3'>dependent co-arising</a>, a detailed map of how craving arises and how it can be brought to cessation by undercutting its preconditions. This map is the <a id='dependent2-3h3'>most complex teaching</a> in the Canon. In a famous passage [<a href='part3.html#passage-231'>&sect;231</a>], Ven. Ananda comments on how clear the doctrine of dependent co-arising seems to him, and the Buddha replies:</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p>Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance. It's because of not understanding &amp; not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein, a knotted ball of string, like matted rushes &amp; reeds, and does not go beyond the cycle of the planes of deprivation, woe, &amp; bad destinations.</p>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, although no explanations can be expected to give a full and final understanding of the process of dependent co-arising, they can provide tools that the meditator can use to probe the process in the course of training the mind and come to an understanding for him or herself. The passages in this section help to provide that set of tools.</p>

<p>A few general points about dependent co-arising are important to understand before going into the details. To begin with, dependent co-arising is often presented in the texts as an expansion of the general principle of <a id='ida-3h3'>this/that conditionality</a> [<a href='part3.html#passage-211'>&sect;211</a>], which we have already discussed in the Introduction. Here we will recapitulate some of the essential points. This/that conditionality is expressed in a simple formula:</p>

<ol>
<li>When this is, that is.</li>
<li>From the arising of this comes the arising of that.</li>
<li>When this isn't, that isn't.</li>
<li>From the stopping of this comes the stopping of that.</li>
</ol>

<p>This formula is <a id='nonlinear-3h3'>non-linear</a>, an interplay of linear and synchronic principles. The linear principle &mdash; taking (2) and (4) as a pair &mdash; <a id='time-3h3'>connects events over time</a>; the synchronic principle &mdash; (1) and (3) &mdash; connects objects and events in the present moment. The two principles intersect, so that any given event is influenced by two sets of conditions, those acting from the past and those acting from the present. Because this is the pattern underlying dependent co-arising, it is a mistake to view dependent co-arising simply as a chain of causes strung out over time. Events in any one category of the list are affected not only by past events in the categories that act as their conditions, but also by the on-going, interacting presence of whole streams of events in those categories. All categories can be present at once, and even though two particular conditions may be separated by several steps in the list, they can be immediately present to each other. Thus they can create the possibility for unexpected <a id='floop-3h3'>feedback loops</a> in the causal process. <i>Feeling,</i> for instance, keeps reappearing at several stages in the process, and <i>ignorance</i> can contribute to any causal link at any time. The importance of these points will become clear when we examine how to disengage the causal network so as to realize the third noble truth.</p>

<p>Because new input into the causal stream is possible at every moment, the actual working out of this/that conditionality and dependent co-arising can be remarkably fluid and complex. This point is borne out by the imagery used in the Canon to illustrate these teachings. <a id='wheel-3h3'>Although</a> some non-canonical texts depict dependent co-arising as a circle or a wheel of causes &mdash; implying something of a mechanical, deterministic process &mdash; the Canon never uses that image at all. Instead it likens dependent co-arising to water flowing over land: lakes overflow, filling rivers, which in turn fill the sea [<a href='part3.html#passage-238'>&sect;238</a>]; while the tides of the sea rise, swelling the rivers, which in turn swell the lakes [SN 12:69]. This imagery captures something of the flow of give and take among the factors of the process. A more modern pattern that might be used to illustrate dependent co-arising is the "strange attractor": an intricate, interwoven pattern that <a id='chaos1-3h3'>chaos theory</a> uses to describe complex, fluid systems containing at least three feedback loops. As we will see below, the number of <a id='floop2-3h3'>feedback loops</a> in dependent co-arising is far more than three.</p>

<p>The fluid complexity of dependent co-arising means that it is inherently unstable, and thus stressful and not-self. Although some non-Theravadin Buddhist texts insist that happiness can be found by abandoning one's smaller, separate identity and embracing the interconnected identity of all interdependent things, this teaching cannot be found in the Pali Canon. The instability of conditioned processes means that they can never provide a dependable basis for happiness. The only true basis for happiness is the <a id='unfab-3h3'>Unfabricated</a>. The Pali discourses are quite clear on the point that the <a id='fabric1-3h3'>fabricated</a> and Unfabricated realms are radically separate. In <a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html">MN 1</a> the Buddha strongly criticizes a group of monks who tried to develop a theory whereby the fabricated was derived out of the Unfabricated or somehow lay within it. Stress, he says, is inherent in the interdependent nature of conditioned phenomena, while the Unfabricated is totally free from stress. Stress could not possibly be produced by absolute freedom from stress. Because the nature of conditioning is such that causes are in turn influenced by their effects, the Unfabricated could not itself function as a cause for anything. The only way the Unfabricated can be experienced is by skillfully using fabricated, conditioned processes (the Wings to Awakening) to unravel the network of fabricated, conditioned processes (dependent co-arising) from within. To do so, one needs to know the individual factors of dependent co-arising and the patterns in which they depend on one another.</p>

<p>These factors come down to the five aggregates. In fact, the entire pattern of dependent co-arising is a map showing how the different aggregates group, disband, and regroup in one another's presence in a variety of configurations, giving rise to stress and to the cosmos at large [<a href='part3.html#passage-212'>&sect;212</a>]. As we have mentioned earlier, one of the most basic features of the Buddha's teachings is his confirmation that the knowable cosmos, composed of old kamma [<a href='part1.html#passage-15'>&sect;15</a>], is made up of the same factors that make up the personality [<a href='part3.html#passage-213'>&sect;213</a>]; and that the interaction of the aggregates, as immediately present to awareness in the here and now, is the same process that underlies the functioning of the knowable cosmos as a whole [<a href='part3.html#passage-212'>&sect;&sect;212-15</a>]. As a result, the descriptions of dependent co-arising slip easily back and forth between two time scales &mdash; events in the present moment and events over the vast cycle of time.</p>

<p>It is important to remember, though, that <a id='present-3h3'>the Buddha discovered</a> this principle by observing events in the immediate present, which is where the individual meditator will have to discover them as well. Thus the practice takes the same approach as phenomenology: exploring the processes of conditioning from the inside as they are immediately experienced in the present moment. This is why the pattern of dependent co-arising lists factors of <a id='consc-3h3'>consciousness</a> &mdash; such as ignorance, attention, and intention &mdash; as prior conditions for the experience of the physical world, for if we take as our frame of reference the world as it is directly experienced &mdash; rather than a world conceived somehow as separate from our experience of it &mdash; we have to see the processes of the mind as prior to the objects they process. References in the texts to the larger frame of space and time provide examples to illustrate particularly subtle points in the immediate present and serve as reminders that the pattern of events observed in the present moment has implications that cover the entire cosmos.</p>

<p>Given the fluid, complex nature of the basic causal principle, it should come as no surprise that the Canon contains several variations on the list of basic factors and configurations in dependent co-arising. Like the seven sets in the Wings to Awakening, these different lists offer the meditator a variety of ways to approach the complexities of the causal stream and to gain a handle on mastering them. The most basic list is found in <a href='part3.html#passage-228'>&sect;228</a> and <a href='part3.html#passage-231'>&sect;231</a>, which give the factors &mdash; starting with the stress of aging and death, and then working backwards &mdash; as follows:</p>

<p><i>Aging and death require birth (i.e., rebirth).</i> If there were no birth, there would be nothing to set in motion the processes of aging and death. Here and in the following causal links, "birth," "aging," and "death" denote not only the arising, decay, and passing away of the body, but also the repeated arising, decay, and passing away of mental states, moment-by-moment in the present. In fact, during the third watch on the night of his Awakening, the Buddha probably focused on present mental states as his primary examples of birth, aging, and death. From them he gained insight into how these processes functioned in the cosmos as a whole.</p>

<p><i>Birth depends on becoming.</i> If there were no coming-into-being of a sensual realm, a realm of form, or a formless realm, there would be no locus for rebirth. Again, these realms refer not only to levels of being on the cosmic scale, but also to levels of mental states. Some mental states are concerned with sensual images, others with forms (such as form jh&#257;na), and still others with formless dimensions, such as the formless jhanas. The relationship between birth and becoming can be compared to the process of falling asleep and dreaming. As drowsiness makes the mind lose contact with waking reality, a dream image of another place and time will appear in it. The appearance of this image is called becoming. The act of entering into this image and taking on a role or identity within it &mdash; and thus entering the world of the dream and falling asleep &mdash; is birth. The <a id='comment1-3h3'>commentaries</a> maintain that precisely the same process is what enables rebirth to follow the death of the body. At the same time, the analogy between falling asleep and taking birth explains why release from the cycle of becoming is called Awakening.</p>

<p><i>Becoming requires clinging/sustenance.</i> The image here is of a <a id='fire-3h3'>fire</a> staying in existence by appropriating sustenance in the act of clinging to its fuel. The process of becoming takes its sustenance from the five aggregates, while the act of taking sustenance is to cling to these aggregates in any of four forms of passion and delight mentioned in <a href="#part3-h-2">III/H/ii</a>: sensual intentions, views, habits and practices, or theories about the self. Without these types of clinging, the realms of sensuality, form, and formlessness would not come into being.</p>

<p><i>Clinging/sustenance requires craving.</i> If one did not thirst (the literal meaning of <i>tanha,</i> or craving) for sensuality, for becoming, or for non-becoming, then the process would not appropriate fuel.</p>

<p><i>Craving requires feeling.</i> If there were no experience of pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful feelings, one would not thirst for continuing experience of the pleasant or for cessation of the unpleasant.</p>

<p><i>Feeling requires contact.</i> Without contact there would be no feelings of pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

<p><i>Contact requires <a id='namarupa-3h3'>name-and-form</a>.</i> "Form" covers all physical phenomena. "Name" here is defined as feeling, perception, contact, attention, and intention. Without these phenomena, there would be nothing to make contact.</p>

<p><i>Name-and-form requires <a id='consc2-3h3'>consciousness</a> of the six sense fields.</i> Without this kind of consciousness, the physical birth of the individual composed of the aggregates would abort, while on the level of momentary mental birth there would be nothing to activate an experience of the aggregates.</p>

<p><i>Consciousness of the six sense fields requires name-and-form.</i> Without name-and-form, there would be no object for this type of consciousness.</p>

<p>In <a href='part3.html#passage-228'>&sect;228</a>, Ven. Sariputta points out that the entire process of dependent co-arising relies on the mutual dependency of name-and-form on the one hand, and sensory consciousness on the other. This mutual dependency is actually composed of many <a id='floop3-3h3'>feedback loops</a>, which can get quite complex. If either of the two factors is pulled away from the other, the whole edifice falls down. For this reason, as we shall see when we discuss the cessation of stress, this mutual dependency is one of the primary points for focusing attention in disbanding the causal process.</p>

<p>Other lists of the factors in <a id='dependent3-3h3'>dependent co-arising</a> expand on this basic list. The most common list adds the factors of the six sense fields between contact and name-and-form, and then states that <i>sensory consciousness requires the three types of fabrication</i> &mdash; bodily, verbal, and mental &mdash; while <i>these fabrications in turn require ignorance</i> of the four noble truths [&sect;&sect;<a href='part3.html#passage-211'>211</a>, <a href='part3.html#passage-218'>218</a>]. There is some disagreement over the meaning of the three types of fabrication in this list. One passage in the Canon [<a href='part3.html#passage-223'>&sect;223</a>], which seems to treat fabrications as they are immediately experienced in the present, defines bodily fabrication as the breath, verbal fabrication as directed thought and evaluation, and mental fabrication as feeling and perception. Other passages [such as <a href='part3.html#passage-225'>&sect;225</a>], which seem to regard fabrications as they function over time, simply class these three types of fabrication as to whether they are meritorious, demeritorious, or imperturbable (i.e., pertaining to the four levels of formless jh&#257;na). If we regard these two definitions as typical of the dual time frame of dependent co-arising, there is no conflict between them.</p>

<p>Another point of disagreement is over the question of how the factors of fabrication and ignorance came to be added to the basic list. Some scholars maintain that this was the result of a temporal development in the Buddha's teachings, either during his lifetime or after his passing away. However, if we examine the content of the added factors, we find that they are simply an elaboration of the mutual dependence between name-and-form and sensory consciousness, and do not add anything substantially new to the list. The three fabrications are simply another way of presenting name-and-form in their active role as shapers of consciousness. Bodily fabrication, the breath, is the active element of "form"; verbal fabrications, directed thought and evaluation, are the active element in the attention and intention sub-factors of "name"; while mental fabrications, feeling and perception, are identical with the feeling and perception under "name." Ignorance, on the other hand, is the type of consciousness that actively promotes <a id='badq-3h3'>inappropriate questioning</a> in the verbal fabrication of evaluation, which in turn can lead to <a id='ayoniso1-3h3'>inappropriate attention</a> in the factor of name-and-form.</p>

<p>It may seem redundant to have the factors of name-and-form on the one hand, and fabrications on the other, covering the same territory in two different configurations, but these configurations serve at least two practical purposes. First, the connection between ignorance and inappropriate questioning helps to pinpoint precisely what is wrong in the typical relationship between name-and-form and consciousness. As one modern teacher has put it, the verbal fabrications are the ones to watch out for. Second, the relationship between verbal fabrications on the one hand, and attention and intention on the other, mediated by consciousness, diagrams the double-tiered (and sometimes multi-tiered) relationships among mental events as they breed and feed on one another in the presence of consciousness. In the course of giving rise to suffering and stress, this incestuous interbreeding can fly out of hand, leading to many complex and intense patterns of suffering. However, its double-tiered quality can also be used &mdash; as we will see below &mdash; to help bring that suffering to an end.</p>

<p>Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-227'>&sect;227</a> adds yet another factor to the list, pointing out another way of looking at the mutually dependent relationships that feed the process of dependent co-arising: <i>ignorance requires the <a id='asava1-3h3'>effluents</a> (asava)</i> of sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance, while <i>these effluents in turn require ignorance</i> of the four noble truths. These added factors point to one of the ways in which the process of dependent co-arising is self-sustaining. Sensuality and views are forms of clinging/sustenance, while becoming is a result of clinging/sustenance. Ignorance as an effluent is nowhere defined in the discourses to differentiate it from simple ignorance, and in fact the distinction may simply be one of role, with both forms of ignorance denoting a state of awareness out of touch with the four noble truths. When ignorance is entwined with the feelings that result from contact, it forms the requisite condition for clinging/sustenance and becoming; together, all of these factors act as impulses that "flow out" of the process and then return to reinforce the ignorance that provides the requisite condition for fabrications, consciousness, and name-and-form, thus fueling another round in the process leading to further becoming and stress.</p>

<p>The self-sustaining nature of dependent co-arising makes it easy to see why <a id='wheel2-3h3'>many non-canonical</a> texts explain it as a wheel. However, the many openings for feedback loops among the various factors &mdash; creating smaller cycles within the larger cycle &mdash; make the process exceedingly complex. This explains why stress and suffering are so bewildering. If they were a simple cycle, there would be little or no variety to the sufferings of living beings, and the process of suffering would be easy for everyone to predict and understand.</p>

<p>Some of the feedback loops that make stress so complex are explicitly mentioned in the texts [<a href='part3.html#passage-227'>&sect;&sect;227-28</a>]. Others are implicit in the fact that particular factors &mdash; such as feeling and contact &mdash; keep re-appearing at different points of the process of dependent co-arising. Feeling is perhaps the most important of these. The stress that forms the final factor of dependent co-arising can be experienced as a feeling, which can then re-enter the causal stream at the factor of fabrications (as a mental fabrication), name-and-form (as an instance of name), or at feeling itself. If it re-enters at feeling, it would then directly condition further craving, which in turn would create a positive feedback loop, leading to increased stress and pain. On the other hand, if the stress re-enters the stream at name-and-form, it could be subjected either to unskillful intentions and inappropriate attention, or to skillful intentions and appropriate attention. The former pair would simply aggravate the stress and pain, whereas the latter pair would weaken the tendency to craving, and thus act as a negative feedback loop, alleviating the conditions that would lead to further stress and pain or eliminating them altogether.</p>

<p>This shows that these feedback loops, instead of being a mere curiosity in the formal structure of dependent co-arising, actually help to explain the wide variations in the way living beings experience stress. They also help explain the possibility of the cessation of stress. The elements of contact, intention, and attention under the factor of "name" are especially important in opening up this latter possibility. As we noted in I/A, this is the factor of dependent co-arising that intersects with the teachings on kamma and skillfulness. Contact &mdash; here, apparently, meaning contact with consciousness &mdash; forms the precondition for kamma [<a href='part1.html#passage-9'>&sect;9</a>]. Intention lies at the essence of the kamma that keeps the cycle of rebirth in motion. Through <a id='yoniso1-3h3'>appropriate attention</a> &mdash; the right way of looking at things and focusing on <a id='quest-3h3'>appropriate questions</a> about them &mdash; kamma can be trained to be skillful and thus lead away from stress rather than toward it. For this reason, any feedback loop that does not pass through the factor of <a id='namarupa2-3h3'>name-and-form</a> will tend simply to continue the problem of stress and pain, whereas any loop that does lead through this factor allows for the possibility for using appropriate attention to weaken the process or disband it entirely.</p>

<p>In feeding the loops of dependent co-arising through the factor of name-and-form, the factor of fabrication plays an especially important role. As we have noted in <a href="#part3-e">III/E</a>, the practice of jh&#257;na focused on the <a id='breath1-3h3'>breath</a> gathers all three forms of fabrication &mdash; bodily, verbal, and mental &mdash; into a single whole. In doing so, it takes all the aggregates that play a variety of roles in the pattern of dependent co-arising, and gathers them into a configuration where appropriate attention can conveniently focus on all their interactions at once.</p>

<p>To express this in terms of the four noble truths, it takes the aggregates that make up the first noble truth and gives them a role in the fourth [<a href="#part3-h-1">III/H/i</a>]. In this way, the double-tiered relationship mentioned above &mdash; between name-and-form on the one hand, and fabrications on the other &mdash; can be put to use in disbanding, rather than compounding, the causal network leading to suffering and stress. In terms of meditation practice, this double-tiered relationship corresponds to the five factors of <a id='nobleconc1-3h3'>noble right concentration</a> [<a href='part3.html#passage-150'>&sect;150</a>]. The three types of fabrication cover the same ground as the four levels of jh&#257;na, while the sub-factor of attention under "name" forms a separate tier of mental activity that allows one to monitor one's practice of jh&#257;na and to develop it as a skill [<a href="part2.html#part2-g">II/G</a>].</p>

<p>As the process of <a id='skill-3h3'>developing skill</a> becomes more and more refined, this tier of attention turns into the fifth, reflective level of noble concentration that allows one to analyze the state of jh&#257;na while it is present, and thus to develop a sharpened discernment of its fabricated nature. As passage <a href='part3.html#passage-172'>&sect;172</a> shows, one begins to see that jh&#257;na is composed not only of such "fabrication" sub-factors as directed thought, evaluation, feeling, and perception, but also of sensory consciousness and such "name" factors as attention, intention, and contact.</p>

<p>In other words, the boundary line between the different tiers of mental activity begins to break down. This allows for the conflation of discernment and concentration noted in <a href="part2.html#part2-h">II/H</a> and <a href="#part3-h">III/H</a>, in which concentrated discernment begins to take its own workings as its object. As discernment in the role of "object" short-circuits with discernment in the role of "approach" [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>], then contact between the factors of name-and-form on the one hand, and sensory consciousness on the other, ceases in a state of clear knowing. In the image of Ven. Sariputta [<a href='part3.html#passage-228'>&sect;228</a>], one of the two sheaves of reeds is pulled away, and the entire edifice of suffering based on them comes tumbling down.</p>

<p>Another crucial point to note in understanding how to <a id='dependent4-3h3'>disband</a> the workings of dependent co-arising is that the relationships between particular factors and their neighbors in the list are not all the same. In some cases, factor <i>x</i> is a <i>sufficient</i> cause for factor <i>y.</i> What this means is that whenever <i>x</i> occurs, <i>y</i> will always have to follow. An example is the relationship between contact and feeling, or between clinging and the remaining factors leading up to stress. Whenever there is contact in the presence of <a id='consc3-3h3'>consciousness</a>, there will have to be feeling. Whenever there is clinging, there will have to be becoming and stress. Thus it is impossible to cut the process at these links. However, there are other cases where <i>x</i> is a <i>necessary</i> cause, but not a sufficient one, for <i>y.</i> In other words, <i>x</i> has to be present for <i>y</i> to occur, but <i>y</i> does not have to follow every time there is <i>x.</i> Examples would include the link between consciousness and name-and-form, between feeling and craving, and between craving and clinging. In each of these cases there has to be an added factor &mdash; the presence of ignorance, the most subtle and basic of the roots of unskillfulness &mdash; for <i>x</i> to give rise to <i>y.</i></p>

<p>This fact is what opens the way for appropriate attention to bring about the end of suffering and stress. At the same time it determines precisely what that way must be. An analysis of how this happens will reveal in a nutshell the convergence of many of the themes of this book: the role of the three levels of frames-of-reference practice [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>], and by extension the three levels in the development of concentration [<a href="#part3-e">III/E</a>] and discernment [<a href="#part3-h">III/H</a>]; the way in which the principles of this/that conditionality and skillfulness [<a href="part1.html#part1-a">I/A</a>] apply to the practice; and the way in which the duties appropriate to the four noble truths &mdash; comprehending stress, abandoning its origination, realizing its cessation, and developing the path [<a href="#part3-h-1">III/H/i</a>] &mdash; in practice are one.</p>

<p><i>The nutshell is this:</i> If each factor in dependent co-arising were a sufficient cause for the following factor, the pattern would be absolutely deterministic and there would be no way out. However, in cases where the link between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> is necessary but not sufficient, then in terms of this/that conditionality, the <i>x</i> factor is input from the past &mdash; even if only a split-second past &mdash; whereas ignorance is the input from the present needed to give rise to <i>y.</i> Thus the strategy of the practice must be to use <a id='yoniso2-3h3'>appropriate attention</a> to eliminate ignorance in the presence of <i>x.</i> To do this, one must focus on comprehending the aggregate that functions as <i>x &mdash;</i> or, in the case of the craving/clinging link, that functions as the potential object of <i>x.</i> At first this means learning to focus on the aggregate in and of itself. Then, to overcome the unskillfulness inherent in ignorance, one must gain practical familiarity with the aggregate in its role as a factor in the skillful practice of jh&#257;na [<a href='part3.html#passage-173'>&sect;173</a>]. As this approach attains a state of mastery, one focuses one's powers of discernment on the "how" of the approach to the practice, taking it as the "what" or object of investigation, until one can see the aggregate even in this role in terms of the four noble truths [<a href="#part3-h-1">III/H/i</a>]. The more precise and comprehensive this knowing, the less craving is produced; the less craving produced, the fewer the effluents that cloud one's knowing. With the culmination of totally clear knowing, ignorance is totally wiped out, together with its attendant craving, and thus the present input that maintained the cycle is ended. <a id='nonfash1-3h3'>This</a> achieves a point of "resonance" [<a href='part1.html'>I/A</a>], the point of non-fashioning at which the cycle breaks down, and where stress and suffering cease.</p>

<p>Modern practice traditions differ as to which links in dependent co-arising they focus on in order to bring about the cessation of craving and thus realize the third noble truth. For the purposes of this essay, we will discuss three of these links as they relate to the three different lists of factors mentioned above. These different points of focus are best regarded as alternative options for tackling the problem of stress and its cessation. All are equally valid, and so it is up to the individual meditator to choose whichever focus seems most congenial and comprehensible, and to follow it through.</p>

<p>The first list of the factors of dependent co-arising, which takes the process down to the <a id='namarupa3-3h3'>mutual dependence</a> of consciousness and name-and-form, emphasizes precisely that link: how name-and-form depends on consciousness, and how consciousness relates to name-and-form. Passage <a href='part3.html#passage-233'>&sect;233</a> treats this point in detail, using the term "fabrication" to cover attention, intention, and contact. In practical terms this approach focuses on the question of how consciousness relates to its objects, making use of skillful intention and appropriate attention (in terms of the four noble truths) as the approach to help peel away any sense of passion or desire for name-and-form. Once the more blatant forms of passion and desire have been eliminated, this approach then peels away passion and desire even for the approach of skillful intentions and appropriate attention themselves. <a id='consc4-3h3'>Consciousness</a> &mdash; thus deprived of its support in name-and-form either in terms of objects or approaches [<a href="part2.html#part2-b">II/B</a>] &mdash; has no basis for proliferation and so is released. Passages related to this perspective on Awakening include &sect;&sect;<a href='part3.html#passage-233'>233</a>, <a href='part3.html#passage-234'>234</a>, and <a href='part3.html#passage-239'>239</a>.</p>

<p>As for the second list, which traces the pattern of dependent co-arising down to fabrication and ignorance, we have already noted that this is simply an explanation of a particular type of relationship between consciousness and name-and-form. We have also noted [<a href="#part3-e">III/E</a>] that all three types of fabrication, in their present aspect, are brought together in the experience of jh&#257;na based on the breath. Thus the question here is how to master jh&#257;na to the point where one can step back in the fifth factor of five-factored noble concentration [<a href='part3.html#passage-150'>&sect;150</a>] so as to overcome one's ignorance of the willed and fabricated nature of jh&#257;na or of any views and assumptions &mdash; based on inappropriate attention &mdash; that might underlie the attainment of jh&#257;na [<a href='part3.html#passage-237'>&sect;237</a>]. With the cessation of ignorance, there is nothing willed or fabricated to form a station of consciousness. At this point of non-fashioning &mdash; where there is no sense of one's doing anything, or of anyone else's doing anything [<a href='part3.html#passage-229'>&sect;229</a>] &mdash; nothing is created for the sake of further becoming or non-becoming. As a result, consciousness is released. Passages related to this perspective on Awakening include <a href='part3.html#passage-225'>&sect;&sect;225-26</a>.</p>

<p>In the third list of dependent co-arising, which traces the pattern to the mutual dependence of ignorance and the effluents, the focus is on the acts of clinging/sustenance and the resultant states of becoming that, conditioned by ignorance, breed more ignorance. The difficulty in focusing on becoming is that its apparent opposite, non-becoming &mdash; the destruction of what has come to be &mdash; can also act as an object of craving leading to further becoming [<a href='part3.html#passage-221'>&sect;&sect;221-22</a>]. Thus the question is how to focus on the drawbacks of sensuality and becoming without falling into the reverse trap of willing non-becoming. As <a href='part3.html#passage-182'>&sect;182</a> shows, this requires seeing the drawbacks of all willed states, regardless of whether the will is aimed at proliferation or destruction. Once the mind has abandoned all such states, the only alternative left open is the equipoise of non-fashioning, the threshold to the <a id='unfab2-3h3'>Unfabricated</a>. Passages related to this perspective on Awakening include <a href='part3.html#passage-221'>&sect;&sect;221-22</a>.</p>

<p>Although these three points of focus differ in emphasis, in essence they come down to different aspects of the same approach. In every case, one must use skillful intentions and appropriate attention to undercut craving and ignorance regarding the five aggregates so that no fabrications will be activated for the sake of further becoming. This lack of activation &mdash; the moment of non-fashioning &mdash; releases consciousness from the aggregates, both in their role as objects of consciousness and in their role as the intention and attention that served as the approaches to release. The differences among the points of focus lie primarily in the questions they ask in framing a view of the problem at hand.</p>

<p>In this we see the <a id='dependent5-3h3'>true function</a> of the teaching of dependent co-arising in practice: as a guide to appropriate attention. Not only does the teaching provide a direct way of viewing experience that avoids useless questions of being and non-being [<a href='part3.html#passage-186'>&sect;186</a>], self and other [<a href='part3.html#passage-228'>&sect;&sect;228-230</a>], it also gives a framework for inspiring alternative ways of asking <a id='quest2-3h3'>appropriate questions</a> about the crucial junctures in the conditioned flow of phenomena in and of themselves. As with all of the Buddha's teachings, once the processes of discernment inspired by the teaching of dependent co-arising have fully performed their function, the teaching itself is transcended in the release of consciousness.</p>

<p>Once consciousness is released from the objects that bring sensory consciousness into play [<a href='part3.html#passage-232'>&sect;232</a>], all that remains is "consciousness without feature, without end, luminous all around" [<a href='part3.html#passage-235'>&sect;235</a>]. This consciousness &mdash; which lies beyond "the extent to which there are means of designation, expression, &amp; description... the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends, the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting (discernibility) of this cosmos" [<a href='part3.html#passage-231'>&sect;231</a>] &mdash; is the experience of the goal.</p>

<p>There is some question as to whether the goal can be equated with the third noble truth. Some passages in the Canon [SN 43:1-44; <a href="../../../../tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.086.than.html">SN 22.86</a>] would seem to indicate yes; others [such as <a href='../../../../tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.5.06.than.html'>Sn V.6</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-1.html#p27">MFU, p. 28</a>; <a href='../../../../tipitaka/an/an10/an10.058.than.html'>AN 10.58</a>; and especially the ending to <a href='../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.027.than.html'>MN 27</a>], no. This contradiction can be resolved by noting that the full realization of the third noble truth and the experience of the goal are two different things so intimately related that the one cannot be experienced without the other. Their relationship can be compared to noticing a long-overlooked valuable in the course of cleaning one's yard. The act of cleaning is not the same as the valuable, but only in the course of doing the former thoroughly and attentively can the latter be found. As one modern teacher has said, the fact that the third noble truth involves a duty means that it is part of fabricated reality, whereas the goal at the end of the path is absolutely unfabricated. Free from all acting and doing, it pertains to an entirely different dimension, and thus &mdash; although found along with the truth of cessation &mdash; it is something utterly beyond and unbound.</p>

<p>From the time of Awakening to that of death, there remains a sense of dissociated contact between the inner and outer sense media that comprise the Awakened One's old kamma [<a href='part1.html#passage-15'>&sect;15</a>] and his/her only remaining experience of the stress inherent in the dimensions of time and the present: contact, in that there is sensitivity to pain and pleasure in these things; dissociated, in that the passion and delight, the fetters, defilements, and attachments in between the inner and outer sense media are totally severed by discernment [<a href="../../../../tipitaka/mn/mn.146.than.html">MN 146</a>; <a href="../likefire/2-4.html#p113">MFU, p. 113</a>]. Old kamma thus runs through the pattern of dependent co-arising from name-and-form and consciousness up through feeling, but &mdash; without the fashioning factors of ignorance and craving &mdash; the feeling of pain and pleasure does not feed back into any causal patterns that would lead to further becoming [<a href='part3.html#passage-219'>&sect;219</a>] or any renewed kamma.</p>

<p>The texts liken this state to a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still glowing and warm [Thag 15:2; <a href="../likefire/2-1.html#p34">MFU, p. 34</a>]. Eventually, old kamma runs out at the death of the Awakened One, and there is a total Unbinding like that of a fire so completely released from its fuel that the embers have grown thoroughly cold. Although this analogy may sound negative in terms of modern ideas about the workings of fire, in the Buddha's time it was recognized as an image, not of extinction or annihilation, but of freedom so unlimited and irreversible that it cannot be described.</p>

<p>The Buddha: If I were to teach you the origination &amp; ending of stress with reference to the past, saying, 'Thus it was in the past,' you would be <a id='doubt209'>doubtful</a> and perplexed. If I were to teach you the origination &amp; ending of stress with reference to the future, saying, 'Thus it will be in the future,' you would be doubtful and perplexed. So instead, I &mdash; sitting right here &mdash; will teach you sitting right there the origination &amp; ending of stress. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak.</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: As you say, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Now, what do you think? Are there any people in Uruvelakappa who, if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured, would cause sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair to arise in you?</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: Yes, there are...</p>

<p>The Buddha: And are there any people in Uruvelakappa who, if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured, would cause no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair to arise in you?</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: Yes, there are...</p>

<p>The Buddha: Now what is the cause, what is the reason, why the murder... of some would cause you sorrow... and the murder... of others would cause you no sorrow...?</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: Those... whose murder... would cause me sorrow... are those for whom I feel desire &amp; passion. Those... whose murder... would cause me no sorrow... are those for whom I feel no desire or passion.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Now, from what you have realized, attained, fathomed right now in the present, without regard to time, you may draw an inference with regard to the past and future: 'Whatever stress, in arising, arose for me in the past, all of it had desire as its root, had desire as its cause, for desire is the cause of stress. And whatever stress, in arising, will arise for me in the future, all of it will have desire as the root, will have desire as its cause &mdash; for desire is the cause of stress.'</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: Amazing, lord. Astounding. How well the Blessed One has put it: Whatever stress, in arising, arose for me in the past, all of it had desire as its root, had desire as its cause, for desire is the cause of stress. And whatever stress, in arising, will arise for me in the future, all of it will have desire as the root, will have desire as its cause, for desire is the cause of stress. I have a son, lord, named <a id='ciravasin209'>C&#299;rav&#257;sin</a>, who lives far away from here. When I get up in the morning, I send a man, saying, 'Go, learn how C&#299;rav&#257;sin is doing.' And as long as that man has not returned, I am simply beside myself, (thinking,) 'Don't let C&#299;rav&#257;sin be sick!'</p>

<p>The Buddha: Now, what do you think? If C&#299;rav&#257;sin were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured, would you feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: If my son C&#299;rav&#257;sin were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured, my very life would be altered. So how could I not feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?</p>

<p>The Buddha: ...And what do you think? Before you had seen or heard of C&#299;rav&#257;sin's mother, did you feel desire, passion, or love for her?</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: And after you had seen or heard of C&#299;rav&#257;sin's mother, did you feel desire, passion, or love for her?</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: Yes, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Now, what do you think? If C&#299;rav&#257;sin's mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured, would you feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?</p>

<p>Gandhabhaka: If C&#299;rav&#257;sin's mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured, my very life would be altered. So how could I not feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?</p>

<p>The Buddha: Thus by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress, when arising, arises: All of it has desire as its root, has desire as its cause &mdash; for desire is the cause of stress.</p>

Whatever aging, decrepitude, brokenness, graying, wrinkling, decline of life-force, weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called aging. Whatever deceasing, passing away, breaking up, disappearance, dying, death, completion of time, break up of the aggregates, casting off of the body, interruption in the life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called death. From the origination of birth comes the origination of aging-&amp;-death. From the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging-&amp;-death. And just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of aging-&amp;-death...</p>

<p>Now, when the disciple of the noble ones discerns aging-&amp;-death in this way, discerns the origination of aging-&amp;-death in this way, discerns the cessation of aging-&amp;-death in this way, discerns the path of practice leading to the cessation of aging-&amp;-death in this way, that is his knowledge of the Dhamma (principle). By means of this principle &mdash; seen, understood, not limited to time, attained, fathomed &mdash; he draws out inferences with regard to the past &amp; future: 'Whatever contemplatives &amp; brahmans in the past comprehended aging-&amp;-death... the origination of aging-&amp;-death... the cessation of aging-&amp;-death... the path of practice leading to the cessation of aging-&amp;-death, all comprehended them as I do now; whatever contemplatives &amp; brahmans in the future will comprehend aging-&amp;-death... the origination of aging-&amp;-death... the cessation of aging-&amp;-death... the path of practice leading to the cessation of aging-&amp;-death, all will comprehend them as I do now.' This is his knowledge of consistency.</p>

<p>Now, when these two knowledges of the disciple of the noble ones &mdash; knowledge of principle &amp; knowledge of consistency &mdash; are pure &amp; clear, he is called a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view, consummate in vision, attained to this true Dhamma. He is said to see this true Dhamma, to be endowed with the knowledge of one in training, endowed with the clear knowing of one in training, attained to the stream of the Dhamma, a person of penetrating noble discernment who stands knocking at the door to the Deathless.</p>

Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?' or that he would run after the future, thinking, 'Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future?

At the end of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One.

one abandons	craving for becoming,

<p><b><a id="passage-230">&sect; 230</a>.</b> The Buddha: 'From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications... From birth as a requisite condition, then old age &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.'</p>

<p>When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One: 'Which aging-&amp;-death, lord? And whose is this aging-&amp;-death?'</p>

<p>'Not a valid question,' the Blessed One said. If one were to ask, "Which aging-&amp;-death? And whose is this aging-&amp;-death?" and if one were to ask, "Is aging-&amp;-death one thing, and is this the aging-&amp;-death of someone/something else?" both of them would have the same meaning, even though their words would differ. When there is the view that the soul is the same as the body, there isn't the leading of the holy life. And when there is the view that the soul is one thing and the body another, there isn't the leading of the holy life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tath&#257;gata points out the Dhamma in between: From birth as a requisite condition comes aging-&amp;-death.'</p>

<p>'Which birth, lord? And whose is this birth?'</p>

<p>'Not a valid question,' the Blessed One said.</p>

<p>[Similarly with all the requisite conditions down to fabrications.]</p>

<p>'...Avoiding these two extremes, the Tath&#257;gata points out the Dhamma in between: From ignorance as requisite condition come fabrications. Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance, every one of these writhings &amp; wrigglings &amp; wigglings &mdash; "Which aging-&amp;-death? And whose is this aging-&amp;-death?" or "Is aging-&amp;-death one thing, and is this the aging-&amp;-death of someone/something else?" or "The soul is the same as the body," or "The soul is one thing and the body another" &mdash; are abandoned, their root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising.'</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-231">&sect; 231</a>.</b> Ven. &#256;nanda: It's amazing, lord, it's astounding, how deep this dependent co-arising is, &amp; how deep its appearance, and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Don't say that, &#256;nanda. Don't say that. Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance. It's because of not understanding &amp; not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein, a knotted ball of string, like matted rushes &amp; reeds, and does not go beyond the cycle of the planes of deprivation, woe, &amp; bad destinations...</p>

<p>'From birth as a requisite condition comes aging-&amp;-death.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from birth as a requisite condition comes aging-&amp;-death. If there were no birth at all, in any way, of anything anywhere... in the utter absence of birth from the cessation of birth, would aging-&amp;-death be discerned?'</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for aging-&amp;-death, i.e., birth. [Similarly for the rest of the requisite conditions down to contact.]</p>

<p>'From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes contact. Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how, from name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes contact. If the qualities, traits, themes, &amp; indicators by which there is a description of name-group [mental activity] were all absent, would designation-contact with regard to the form-group [the physical properties] be discerned?</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: If the permutations, signs, themes, &amp; indicators by which there is a description of form-group were all absent, would resistance-contact with regard to the name-group be discerned?</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: If the permutations, signs, themes, &amp; indicators by which there is a description of name-group &amp; form-group were all absent, would designation-contact or resistance-contact be discerned?</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for contact, i.e., name-&amp;-form.</p>

<p>'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form. If consciousness were not to descend into the mother's womb, would name-&amp;-form take shape in the womb?</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: If, after descending into the womb, consciousness were to depart, would name-&amp;-form be produced for this world?</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off, would name-&amp;-form ripen, grow, &amp; reach maturity?</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for name-&amp;-form, i.e., consciousness.</p>

<p>'From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness. If consciousness were not to gain a foothold in name-&amp;-form, would a coming-into-play of the origination of birth, aging, death, &amp; stress in the future be discerned? [<a href='part3.html#passage-233'>&sect;233</a>]</p>

<p>Ven. &#256;nanda: No, lord.</p>

<p>The Buddha: Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for consciousness, i.e., name-&amp;-form.</p>

<p>This is the extent to which there is birth, aging, death, passing away, &amp; re-arising. This is the extent to which there are means of designation, expression, &amp; description. This is the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends, the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting [discernibility] of this world &mdash; i.e., name-&amp;-form together with consciousness.</p>

In dependence on the eye &amp; forms there arises eye-consciousness. The eye is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Forms are inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Thus this pair is both fleeting &amp; unsettled &mdash; inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Eye-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.

Should consciousness, when taking a stance, stand attached to feeling... to perception... to fabrications... it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. Were someone to say, 'I will describe a coming, a going, a passing away, an arising, a growth, an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form, from feeling, from perception, from fabrications,' that would be impossible.</p>

<p>If a monk abandons passion for the property of form... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness, then owing to the abandoning of passion, the support is cut off, and there is no base for consciousness. Consciousness thus unestablished &mdash; not proliferating, not performing any function &mdash; is released. Owing to its release, it is steady. Owing to its steadiness, it is contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated. Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within. He discerns, 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.

<p><b><a id="passage-237">&sect; 237</a>.</b> Then Ven. &#256;nanda, together with a group of monks, went to where the Blessed One was staying in P&#257;lileyyaka, at the root of the Auspicious Sal Tree, and on arrival, after bowing down to him, sat down to one side. As they were sitting there, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, &amp; encouraged them with a talk on Dhamma.</p>

<p>Then this train of thought appeared in the awareness of one of the monks: 'Now I wonder &mdash; knowing in what way, seeing in what way, does one without delay put an end to the effluents?'</p>

<p>The Blessed One, perceiving with his awareness the train of thought in the monk's awareness, said to the monks, 'I have analyzed &amp; taught you the Dhamma, monks. I have analyzed &amp; taught you the four frames of reference, the four right exertions, the four bases of power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors for Awakening, &amp; the noble eightfold path... And yet still there appears this train of thought in the awareness of one of the monks: "Now I wonder &mdash; knowing in what way, seeing in what way, does one without delay put an end to the effluents?"</p>

<p>'Well then &mdash; knowing in what way, seeing in what way, does one without delay put an end to the effluents? There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person... assumes form to be the self. That assumption is a fabrication. Now what is the cause, what is the origination, what is the birth, what is the coming-into-existence of that fabrication? To an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that. And that fabrication is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. That craving... That feeling... That contact... That ignorance is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. It's by knowing &amp; seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents.</p>

<p>'Or he doesn't assume form to be the self, but he assumes the self as possessing form... form as in the self... self as in form... or feeling to be the self... the self as possessing feeling... feeling as in the self... self as in feeling... or perception to be the self... the self as possessing perception... perception as in the self... self as in perception... or fabrications to be the self... the self as possessing fabrications... fabrications as in the self... self as in fabrications... or consciousness to be the self... the self as possessing consciousness... consciousness as in the self... self as in consciousness.</p>

<p>'Now that assumption is a fabrication. What is the cause... of that fabrication? To an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that. And that fabrication is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. That craving... That feeling... That contact... That ignorance is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. It's by knowing &amp; seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents.</p>

<p>'Or... he may have a view such as this: "This self is the same as the cosmos. This I will be after death, constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change." This eternalist view is a fabrication... Or... he may have a view such as this: "I would not be, neither would there be what is mine. I will not be, neither will there be what is mine." This annihilationist view is a fabrication... Or... he may be <a id='doubt237'>doubtful</a> &amp; uncertain, having come to no conclusion with regard to the true Dhamma. That doubt, uncertainty, &amp; coming-to-no-conclusion is a fabrication.</p>

<p>'What is the cause... of that fabrication? To an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance, craving arises.

<p><b><a id="passage-239">&sect; 239</a>.</b> Before my self-awakening, when I was still just an unawakened <a id='bodhisatta239'>Bodhisatta</a>, the realization came to me: 'How this world has fallen on difficulty! It is born, it ages, it dies, it falls away &amp; rearises, but it does not discern the escape from this stress, from this aging-&amp;-death. O when will it discern the escape from this stress, from this aging-&amp;-death?'</p>

<p>Then the thought occurred to me, 'Aging-&amp;-death exists when what exists? From what as a requisite condition is there aging-&amp;-death?' From my <a id='yoniso239'>appropriate attention</a> there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Aging-&amp;-death exists when birth exists. From birth as a requisite condition comes aging-&amp;-death.' Then the thought occurred to me, 'Birth exists when what exists? From what as a requisite condition comes birth?' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Birth exists when becoming exists. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth... 'Name-&amp;-form exists when what exists? From what as a requisite condition is there name-&amp;-form?' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Name-&amp;-form exists when consciousness exists. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form.' Then the thought occurred to me, 'Consciousness exists when what exists? From what as a requisite condition comes consciousness?' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Consciousness exists when name-&amp;-form exists. From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness.'</p>

<p>Then the thought occurred to me, 'This consciousness turns back at name-&amp;-form, and goes no farther. It is to this extent that there is birth, aging, death, falling away, &amp; re-arising, i.e., from name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness, from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form. From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media... Thus is the origination of this entire mass of stress. Origination, origination.' Vision arose, clear knowing arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before.</p>

<p>Then the thought occurred to me, 'Aging-&amp;-death doesn't exist when what doesn't exist? From the cessation of what comes the cessation of aging-&amp;-death?' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Aging-&amp;-death doesn't exist when birth doesn't exist. From the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging-&amp;-death.'... 'Name-&amp;-form doesn't exist when what doesn't exist? From the cessation of what comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form?' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Name-&amp;-form doesn't exist when consciousness doesn't exist. From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form.' Then the thought occurred to me, 'Consciousness doesn't exist when what doesn't exist? From the cessation of what comes the cessation of consciousness?' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Consciousness doesn't exist when name-&amp;-form doesn't exist. From the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of consciousness.'</p>

<p>The thought occurred to me, 'I have attained this path to Awakening, i.e., from the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of consciousness, from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media... Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of stress. Cessation, cessation.' Vision arose, clear knowing arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before.</p>

<p>It's just as if a man, traveling along a wilderness track, were to see an <a id='ancient239'>ancient path</a>, an ancient road, traveled by people of former times. He would follow it. Following it, he would see an ancient city, an ancient capital inhabited by people of former times, complete with parks, groves, &amp; ponds, walled, delightful. He would go to address the king or the king's minister, saying, 'Sire, you should know that while traveling along a wilderness track I saw an ancient path... I followed it... I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital... complete with parks, groves, &amp; ponds, walled, delightful. Sire, rebuild that city!' The king or king's minister would rebuild the city, so that at a later date the city would become powerful, rich, &amp; well-populated, fully grown &amp; prosperous.</p>

<p>In the same way I saw an ancient path, an ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times. And what is that ancient path...? Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration... I followed that path. Following it, I came to direct knowledge of aging-&amp;-death, direct knowledge of the origination of aging-&amp;-death, direct knowledge of the cessation of aging-&amp;-death, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging-&amp;-death. I followed that path. Following it, I came to direct knowledge of birth... becoming... clinging... craving... feeling... contact... the six sense media... name-&amp;-form... consciousness, direct knowledge of the origination of consciousness, direct knowledge of the cessation of consciousness, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousness. I followed that path.</p>

<p>Following it, I came to direct knowledge of fabrications, direct knowledge of the origination of fabrications, direct knowledge of the cessation of fabrications, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of fabrications. Knowing that directly, I have revealed it to monks, nuns, male lay followers, &amp; female lay followers, so that this holy life has become powerful, rich, detailed, well-populated, wide-spread, proclaimed among celestial &amp; human beings.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-240">&sect; 240</a>.</b> Now at that time <a id='subhadda240'>Subhadda</a> the wanderer was staying in Kusin&#257;r&#257;. He heard, 'Tonight, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place.' Then this thought occurred to him: 'I have heard the venerable elder wanderers, teachers of teachers, saying that only once in a long, long time do Tath&#257;gatas &mdash;  worthy ones, rightly self-awakened &mdash; appear in the world.

<p>So he went to the Mallan Sal Tree grove, to <a id='ananda240'>Ven. &#256;nanda</a>, and on arrival said to him, 'I have heard the venerable elder wanderers, teachers of teachers, saying that only once in a long, long time do Tath&#257;gatas &mdash; worthy ones, rightly self-awakened &mdash; appear in the world.

Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me, but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt.

<p>When this was said, Ven. &#256;nanda said to him, 'Enough, friend Subhadda. Do not bother the Blessed One. The Blessed One is tired.'</p>

<p>For a second time... For a third time, Subhadda the wanderer said to Ven. &#256;nanda, '... It would be good, Master &#256;nanda, if I could get to see him.'</p>

<p>For a third time, Ven. &#256;nanda said to him, 'Enough, friend Subhadda. Do not bother the Blessed One. The Blessed One is tired.'</p>

<p>Now, the Blessed One heard the exchange between Ven. &#256;nanda &amp; Subhadda the wanderer, and so he said to Ven. &#256;nanda, 'Enough, &#256;nanda. Do not stand in his way. Let him see the Tath&#257;gata. Whatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge, and not to be bothersome. And whatever I answer when asked, he will quickly understand.'</p>

<p>So Ven. &#256;nanda said to Subhadda the wanderer, 'Go ahead, friend Subhadda. The Blessed One gives you his leave.'</p>

<p>Then Subhadda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, 'Venerable sir, these contemplatives &amp; brahmans, each with his group, each with his community, each the teacher of his group, an honored leader, well-regarded by people at large &mdash; i.e., <a id='purana240'>P&#363;ra&#7751;a Kassapa</a>, <a id='makkhali240'>Makkhali Gos&#257;la</a>, <a id='ajita240'>Ajita Kesakambalin</a>, <a id='pakudha240'>Pakudha Kacc&#257;yana</a>, <a id='sanjaya240'>Sa&ntilde;jaya Bela&#7789;&#7789;haputta</a>, &amp; <a id='nataputta240'>Niga&#7751;&#7789;ha N&#257;&#7789;aputta</a>: Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim, or do they all not have direct knowledge, or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not?'</p>

<p>'Enough, Subhadda. Put this question aside. I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak.'</p>

<p>'As you say, lord,' Subhadda responded, and the Blessed One said, 'In any doctrine &amp; discipline where the noble eightfold path is not ascertained, no contemplative of the first... second... third... fourth order [<a id='sotapanna240'>stream-winner</a>, <a id='sakadagami240'>once-returner</a>, <a id='anagami240'>non-returner</a>, or <a id='arahant240'>Arahant</a>] is ascertained. But in any doctrine &amp; discipline where the noble eightfold path is ascertained, contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order are ascertained. The noble eightfold path is ascertained in this doctrine &amp; discipline, and right here are contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world will not be empty of Arahants.</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
At age twenty-nine I went forth,
	seeking what might be skillful,
and since my going forth
	more than fifty years have passed.
Outside of the realm
of methodical Dhamma,
	there is no contemplative.
</div>

<p>And no contemplative of the second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world will not be empty of Arahants.'</p>

<p>Then Subhadda the wanderer said, 'Magnificent, lord, magnificent! In many ways has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear &mdash; just as if one were to place upright what has been overturned, to reveal what has been hidden, to point out the way to one who is lost, or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks. Let me obtain the going forth in the Blessed One's presence, let me obtain admission.'</p>

<p>'Anyone, Subhadda, who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth &amp; admission in this doctrine &amp; discipline, must first undergo probation for four months. If, at the end of four months, the monks are pleased (with his behavior), they give him the going forth &amp; admit him to the monk's state. But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter.'</p>

<p>'Lord, if that is so, I am willing to undergo probation for four years. If, at the end of four years, the monks are pleased, let them give me the going forth &amp; admit me to the monk's state.'</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One said to Ven. &#256;nanda, 'Very well then, &#256;nanda, give Subhadda the going forth.'</p>

<p>'As you say, lord,' Ven. &#256;nanda responded.</p>

<p>Then Subhadda said to Ven. &#256;nanda, 'It is a gain for you, friend &#256;nanda, a great gain, that you have been anointed here in the Teacher's presence with the pupil's anointing.'</p>

<p>Then Subhadda the wanderer received the going forth, he received the admission in the Blessed One's presence. And not long after his admission &mdash; dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute &mdash; he in no long time entered &amp; remained in the unexcelled goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew, 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.' And thus Ven. Subhadda became another one of the Arahants, the last of the Blessed One's face-to-face disciples.</p>
