  </dt>
<dd>In this essay, presented at an interfaith conference in Sri Lanka, the author describes the "radical secularization" of human life that lies at the root of the manifold social problems in the modern world. Religious fundamentalism and spiritual eclecticism have emerged as two counterproductive reactions to this state of affairs. The author enumerates several fundamental tasks that practitioners from all the world's great religions must undertake as part of a sane response to the current crisis. </dd>

  </dt>
<dd>The Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar (MN 11) deals with the delicate question of whether different spiritual paths all lead to the same ultimate goal. If not, the question arises of defining the critical line that distinguishes them, and it is this question that the Buddha attempts to answer in this sutta. The Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar (MN 12) is a text of awesome scope and power in which the Buddha discloses the greatness and loftiness of his own spiritual endowments. Spoken as a rebuttal to the charges of a renegade disciple, the sutta has had such a powerful impact that in ancient times it was also known as "The Hair-Raising Discourse." <span class='summary_source'>[From the back cover.]</span> </dd>

  </dt>
<dd>The Venerable Maha Kaccana was one of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, appointed by the Awakened One as the monk most skilled in explaining in detail the meaning of his own brief utterances. Often the other monks turned to Maha Kaccana for help in clarifying the meaning of the Buddha's condensed statements, and thus we find in the Pali canon a sheaf of suttas, all of great importance, spoken by this eminent disciple. [This book] offers a short biographical sketch of the Venerable Maha Kaccana, followed by a more detailed survey of the discourses ascribed to him in the Pali canon. These texts, always methodically refined and analytically precise, help to bring to light the far-ranging implications and profund relevance of the liberating teachings of the Buddha. <span class='summary_source'>[From the back cover.]</span> </dd>

<dd>A concise yet thorough explanation of the Eightfold Path, the practical method the Buddha prescribed to uproot and eliminate the underlying causes of suffering. Basing himself solidly upon the Buddha's own words, the author examines each factor of the path to determine exactly what it implies in the way of practical training. Finally, in the concluding chapter, he shows how all eight factors of the path function together to bring about the realization of the Buddhist goal: enlightenment and liberation. </dd>

<dd>Although Theravada Buddhism explicitly advocates the attainment of arahantship as the ultimate goal, in the course of its historical evolution the Theravada tradition gave birth to a rich body of teachings on the practices of a bodhisatta, an aspirant to Supreme Buddhahood. In about the sixth century CE the great commentator Acariya Dhammapala collected and systematized these diverse teachings on the bodhisatta into a single treatise, which he included in his commentary on the late canonical work, the Cariyapitaka. This treatise, which draws freely from a Mahayana work  entitled the <i>Bodhisattvabhumi,</i> provides a detailed examination of the ten <i>paramis,</i> the sublime virtues that a bodhisatta must practice over innumerable lives in order to reach the plane of supreme Supreme Buddhahood. This booklet contains a lucid and inspiring translation of this treatise, slightly abridged, which should throw a valuable sidelight on an aspect of the Theravada Buddhist often overlooked in popular accounts. <span class='summary_source'>[From the back cover.]</span> </dd>

<dd>Among the most crucial challenges we face in our journey down the Buddhist path is a willingness to see ourselves as we truly are &mdash; defilements and all.

<dd>Some popular contemporary teachings claim that the Buddha advocates putting one's trust solely in what one can know and experience directly for oneself.

<dd>As Buddhism takes root in the West, it shows ominous signs of decline in parts of Asia, where the youth often dismiss it as an irrelevant symbol of cultural and ethnic identity.

<dd>In a world full of such extraordinary suffering it becomes second-nature to many of us to turn aside from the pain of others, cast our gaze downward, and focus instead on our own immediate, private concerns. Equipped with an understanding of the workings of <i>kamma,</i> however, we can begin to see the world with more heartfelt clarity, with greater equanimity, free of paralyzing despair.

<dd>In a world increasingly dominated by the wonders of scientific progress and the lure of technological innovation, we can easily lose touch with that vital human drive to seek an ultimate, transcendent meaning to life. The Buddha's teachings offer both that transcendent goal toward which we can aim our lives, and a practical method of reaching it. (Winter 1989) </dd>

<dd>Some popular interpretations of Buddhism espouse the notion that our highest goal should be to expand our capacity to open ourselves to the full range of life's joys and sorrows, to shed our self-centered preferences, and merge at last with the unity of all beings and all things. Despite its superficially soothing sound, this teaching is far removed from Buddhism's real message of genuine freedom. (Winter 1990-91) </dd>

Nor do the teachings espouse "dualism" &mdash; or, for that matter, any <i>-ism</i> whatsoever. Rather, the teachings concern only suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. (2<sup>nd</sup> mailing, 1994 &amp; 1<sup>st</sup> mailing, 1995) </dd>

<dd>Newcomers to Buddhism, inspired by the down-to-earth clarity, directness, and immediacy of the Buddha's teachings, often stumble when they first encounter the teachings on rebirth.
