<h1><a id='intro'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>The Sa.myutta Nikaaya is one of the five great divisions of the Sutta Pi.taka of the Paali canon, the Tipi.taka or "Three Baskets" of doctrine, constituting the Buddha-word for Theravaada Buddhism. The meaning of "Sa.myutta Nikaaya" is "The Collection of Grouped Discourses" and it is so called because its material is arranged into groups (sa.myuttas) according to subject, of which there are fifty-six. These again are placed into five <i>vaggas</i>, sections or chapters, corresponding to the five divisions of this anthology. In the Paali Text Society's complete edition (under the title <i>Kindred Sayings</i>) the whole work is contained in five volumes, covering over 1,650 pages, so it will be realized that this anthology is a very small selection indeed of the complete Sa.myutta Nikaaya.</p>
<p>The present anthology differs from others that have appeared in that it is not arranged in any special order, merely following the order of the text itself, and that it is confined to just one part of the Paali Tipi.taka. As regards the choice of material, an attempt was made to make it as representative as possible of the whole collection, but personal preference could not be ignored. Choice tended to fall upon the more striking discourses, the avoidance of passages that were too repetitive and the inclusion of those that contained similes and parables, so profoundly illuminating and easily remembered.</p>

<p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthi, at the Jeta Grove in Anaathapi.n.dika's monastery. Now when night was passing a certain devataa, lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with her surpassing beauty, approached the Lord. Having drawn near and prostrated herself she stood to one side.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a></p>
<p>Standing there the devataa said:</p>
<div class="verse"><pre>
Those living in the forest,
Peaceful and calm, of pure life,
Eating but one meal a day:
How is it they appear so radiant?
</pre>
</div>
<p>The Lord replied:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
They sorrow not for what is past,
They have no longing for the future,
The present is sufficient for them:
Hence it is they appear so radiant.
By having longing for the future,
By sorrowing over what is past,
By this fools are withered up
As a cut down tender reed.

<p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anaathapi.n.dika's monastery. Then the king Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Lord. Having drawn near and prostrated himself he sat down to one side. As he was sitting there king Pasenadi said to the Lord:</p>
<p>"When, Sir, I had retired and was alone this was the reflection that arose in my mind: Who loves himself? Who does not love himself? And then, Sir, I thought: Those who practice wrong conduct by body, speech and thought, they do not love themselves. Even though they should say, 'We love ourselves,' yet they do not love themselves. What is the reason? They do to themselves what a hater would do to someone he hates. Therefore they do not love themselves.</p>
<p>"But those who practice good conduct by body, speech and thought, they love themselves. Even though they should say, 'We do not love ourselves,' yet they do love themselves. What is the reason? They do to themselves what a friend would do to a friend. Therefore they love themselves."</p>
<p>"So it is, O King, so it is..."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10' id='fnt-10'>[10]</a></p>

<pre>
He who holds his own self dear,
With evil let him not be linked.

Is not a bargain that is good.

And losing his humanity,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-12' id='fnt-12'>[12]</a> 
What use for him is property
And what can he then take away?
What is it that will follow him
Like his own shadow never parting?

Both the good and evil deeds
Which a mortal here performs,
These are his property indeed
That he will take away with him.
His deeds will follow after him
Like his own shadow never parting.
Hence noble deeds should be performed,
A storing for the future life.
Good deeds will in the world beyond
Bestow on beings goodly help.

<p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Lord was stating among the Sakyas at Silaavati and a large number of bhikkhus were dwelling close by, diligent and energetic, devoting themselves [to the practice of meditation].</p>
<p>Now Maara, the evil one,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-15' id='fnt-15'>[15]</a> assuming the appearance of a braahmana, with a great pile of matted hair on his head and wearing a leopard-skin cloak, an old man, bent like a roof-beam, breathing heavily and grasping an udumbara-wood staff approached those bhikkhus and said:</p>
<p>"You ascetics are still boys! Young and black-haired, in the flush of youth! You are in the prime of life and have not yet amused yourselves with [worldly sensual] pleasures. Enjoy [natural] human pleasures, goods sirs! Do not abandon what is visible here and now and run after distant things."</p>
<p>"We have not abandoned what is visible here and now, braahmana, nor are we running after distant things. We have abandoned what is distant and run towards what is visible here and now. The Lord has said [worldly] pleasures are distant [of uncertain result], produce much suffering and despair and are a continual disappointment. But this Dhamma is visible here and now, immediate [in result], inviting one to come and see, guiding one onward and capable of being experienced by the wise."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-16' id='fnt-16'>[16]</a></p>
<p>When they had so spoken, Maara, the evil one, departed shaking his head, lolling out his tongue, frowning and leaning on his staff. Then those bhikkhus approached the Lord... [and told him all that has occurred and thereupon the Lord said:]</p>
<p>"That was no braahmana, bhikkhus, that was Maara, the evil one, come to cloud your clarity of vision."</p>

<p>At Saavatthii. Now the bhikkhunii<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20' id='fnt-20'>[20]</a> Vajiraa, having robed herself and taken her bowl and upper robe, entered Saavatthii before noon to collect food. Having wandered through Saavatthii and returned after her meal, she entered the Andha Grove and sat down at the foot of a certain tree to rest during the heat of midday. Then Maara, the evil one, approached the bhikkhunii Vajiraa and, desiring to cause fear and consternation, to make her hair stand on end and cause her to fall away from concentration of mind, addressed her with this verse:</p>

<p>By whom was this being made?
Where is the maker of the being?
From where does a being arise?
Where does a being cease?"</p>

<p>Then the bhikkhunii Vajiraa thought, "Who is this human or non-human being who speaks this verse?" And then she thought, "It is Maara, the evil one, desiring to cause me fear and consternation, to make my hair stand on end and cause me to fall away from concentration of mind." So the bhikkhunii Vajiraa, realizing that it was Maara, the evil one, replied to him in verse:</p>

<p>A being! Why seize upon this word?
A wrong view Maara surely has?
A mere heap of conditions this,
Where no "being" can be found.</p>

<p>As when, with all its parts assembled,
"Chariot" is the word then used,
So when the aggregates<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-21' id='fnt-21'>[21]</a> exist
One speaks of 'being" by convention.</p>

<p>It is just suffering that arises,
Suffering that stays and disappears.
Nothing but suffering arises,
Suffering ceases and nothing else."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-22' id='fnt-22'>[22]</a></p>

<p>And Maara, the evil one, thinking, "The bhikkhunii Vajiraa recognizes me," vanished away, grieved and dejected.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-23' id='fnt-23'>[23]</a></p>

<p>"When a noble disciple has well seen this dependent arising and those dependently arisen phenomena according to actuality with perfect wisdom, it does not occur to him that he should run back to the past, saying 'Did I exist in the past?'  'Did I not exist in the past?'  'What was I in the past?'  'What was I like in the past?'  'Having been what, what did I become in the past?'</p>

<p>"Nor that he should now in the present have doubts within himself, saying, 'Am I?'  'Am I not?'  'What am I?'  'What am I like?' 'This being [that is, myself], where did it come from, where will it go to?'</p>

<p>"An uninstructed ordinary person, bhikkhus, might well be dispassionate towards this body, made of the four great elements, might well detach himself and be released from it. For what reason? It is seen how this body grows and decays, is taken up and laid aside. Therefore an uninstructed ordinary person might well be dispassionate toward it, might well detach himself and be released from it. But this, bhikkhus, which is called mind, is called thought, is called consciousness &mdash; towards this an uninstructed ordinary person is not able to be dispassionate, is not able to be detached and released. What is the reason? For a long time this has been that with which he identifies himself, to which he has been attached and has held on to, thinking, 'This is mine,' 'I am this,'  'This is myself.' Therefore an uninstructed ordinary person is not able to be dispassionate towards it, to be detached and released from it.</p>
<p>"It would be better, bhikkhus, if an uninstructed ordinary person regarded this body, made of the four great elements, as himself rather than the mind. For what reason? This body is seen to continue for a year, for two years, five years, ten years, twenty years, fifty years, a hundred years and even more. But of that which is called mind, is called thought, is called consciousness, one moment arises as another ceases continually both day and night. Just as a monkey wandering in a big forest seizes a branch and letting go of it seizes another: similarly, bhikkhus, of that which is called mind, is called thought, is called consciousness, one moment arises as another ceases continually both day and night.</p>
<p>"Now as to this, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple gives well reasoned attention to the dependent arising thus: this being, that is; from the arising of this, that arises: this not being, that is not; from the ceasing of this, that ceases.</p>
<p>"That is to say, with ignorance as condition, volitional activities come to be; with volitional activities as condition, consciousness comes to be... That is how there is an origin of this whole mass of suffering. But from the complete disappearance and cessation of ignorance, volitional activities cease...

It cognizes sour and bitter, acid and sweet, alkaline and non-alkaline, salty and non-salty. 'It cognizes,' bhikkhus, therefore it is called 'consciousness.'</p>

So the Kinsman of the AAdicca<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-66' id='fnt-66'>[66]</a> did illustrate.

In whatever way it is observed
And properly examined,
Empty it is and unsubstantial,
To him who sees it wisely.

This body at the outset,
Was taught by him of wisdom wide,
When abandoned of three things
Is cast aside, rejected:
Life, warmth and consciousness,
When body is bereft of these,
Then thrown away it lies
Insentient, mere food for others.

Such is the fate of it,
A prattling illusion,
A murderer, it is called;
No essence here is found.

Thus should the aggregates be looked upon
By a bhikkhu of strong energy,
Continually both day and night,
Clearly aware and mindful.

Let him leave behind all fetters,
Make a refuge for himself and,
As though his head were all afire,
Act aspiring for the deathless state.

<p>"Unimaginable, bhikkhus, is a beginning to the round of births [and deaths]. For beings obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, migrating and going the round of births, a starting point is not evident.</p>

<p>"Similarly, bhikkhus, the uninstructed ordinary person looks upon the body as, 'This is mine,' 'I am this,' 'This is myself,'... He looks upon feeling... perception... mental activities... consciousness as, 'This is mine,' 'I am this,' 'This is myself.' If he moves, he moves towards these five aggregates of grasping; if he stands still, he stands close to these five aggregates of grasping; if he sits down, he sits close to these five aggregates of grasping; if he lies down, he lies close to these five aggregates of grasping.</p>
<p>"Hence, bhikkhus, I say one should constantly reflect upon one's own mind thus: 'For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed, aversion and delusion.' Through a corrupt mind, bhikkhus, beings are corrupted; from purity of mind beings become pure. Have you seen, bhikkhus, an elaborate painting?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
<p>"Now that elaborate painting, bhikkhus, was devised by mind. Therefore mind is even more intricate than that elaborate painting. Hence, bhikkhus, I say one should constantly reflect upon one's own mind thus: 'For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed, aversion and delusion.' Through a corrupt mind, bhikkhus, beings are corrupted; from purity of mind beings become pure.</p>

<p>"Just as a dyer or a painter, with dye or lac or turmeric or indigo or madder, and a well-smoothed wooden panel or wall or piece of cloth, can reproduce the form (<i>ruupa</i>) of a woman or a man complete in every detail &mdash; similarly, bhikkhus, the uninstructed ordinary person brings body (<i>ruupa</i>) into existence too... brings feeling... perception... mental activities... brings consciousness into existence too."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-68' id='fnt-68'>[68]</a></p>

<p>"Because of being caught (<i>satto</i>) and held fast (<i>visatto</i>) by that desire, that attachment, that delight, that craving for body... for feeling... for perception... for mental activities... for consciousness, therefore one is called 'a being' (<i>satto</i>).</p>
<p>"Just as when little boys or girls are playing with mud-pies. As long as they are not rid of attachment to those mud-pies, are not rid of desire, are not rid of affection, thirst, excitement, and craving for them, so long do they delight in them, are amused by them, value, and cherish them. But when those little boys or girls are rid of attachment to those mud-pies, are rid of desire, are rid of affection, thirst, excitement, and craving for them, then with hand and foot they scatter them, destroy them, demolish them, stop playing with them.</p>
<p>"In the same way, Raadha, do you scatter body, destroy it, demolish it, stop playing with it, do you practice so as to end craving for it. Do you scatter feeling... perception... mental activities... consciousness, destroy it, demolish it, stop playing with it, do you practice so as to end craving for it.</p>

<p>"...but if a bhikkhu does not delight in them, does not welcome them, does not cleave to them... enjoyment ceases. The cessation of enjoyment is the cessation [also] of suffering, I say.</p>
<p>"Now that you have been instructed by me, Pu.n.na, with this brief instruction in what country will you live?"</p>
<p>"There is, Sir, a country called Sunaaparanta, I will live there."</p>

It would be thus with me, Lord. It would be thus with me, Happy One."</p>
<p>"But if the men of Sunaaparanta were to strike you with their hands, how would it be with you?"</p>

<p>"But if the men of Sunaaparanta were to deprive you of your life, how would it be with you?"</p>

<p>"It is good, it is good Pu.n.na. Being endowed with this self-mastery and composure you will be able to settle in the country of the Sunaaparanta people. Do now, Pu.n.na, whatever you consider it the time for."</p>
<p>Then the venerable Pu.n.na, pleased and appreciative of the Lord's utterance, arose from his seat, prostrated himself before the Lord and, keeping his right side towards him, departed. And having put away his bed and seat and taking his bowl and robe he set off for the country of Sunaaparanta. And walking, journeying by stages, the venerable Pu.n.na arrived in the country of Sunaaparanta and dwelt there.</p>

<p>"A wise man, bhikkhus was the clansman Pu.n.na. He practiced according to Dhamma and did not trouble me with queries about Dhamma. The clansman Pu.n.na, bhikkhus, has attained final release."</p>

<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Kosambii on the bank of the river Ganges. Now the Lord saw a large log of wood being carried along by the current of the river Ganges and on seeing it said to the bhikkhus:</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, do you see that large log of wood being carried along by the current of the river Ganges?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
<p>"If that log of wood, bhikkhus, does not run aground on the near bank or the far bank, does not sink in midstream, is not caught on a sandbank, is not seized by humans or non-humans, is not held in a whirlpool, does not rot from within &mdash; then that log of wood will float down to the ocean, will be led down to the ocean, will tend towards the ocean.</p>
<p>"Similarly, bhikkhus, if you do not run aground on the near bank or the far bank, if you do not sink in midstream, if you are not caught on a sandbank, if you are not seized by humans or non-humans, if you are not held in a whirlpool, If you do not rot from within &mdash; then you will float down to Nibbaana, you will be led down to Nibbaana, you will tend towards Nibbaana. What is the reason? Right view, bhikkhus, floats to Nibbaana, leads to Nibbaana, tends towards Nibbaana."</p>
<p>On this being said a certain bhikkhu asked the Lord: "What, Sir, is the near bank? What is the far bank? What is sinking in midstream? What is being caught on a sandbank? What is being seized by humans? What is being seized by non-humans? What is being held in a whirlpool? What is rotting from within?"</p>
<p>"'The near bank,' bhikkhu, is a designation for the six internal sense-bases. 'The far bank' is a designation for the six external sense-bases. 'Sinking in midstream' is a designation for enjoyment and attachment. 'Being caught on a sandbank' is a designation for the 'I am-conceit.' Now what is 'being seized by humans'? Herein a bhikkhu lives in close association with lay folk. He shares their joys and sorrows. He is happy with those who are happy, he suffers with those who suffer. He involves himself in all manner of business that goes on. This is called 'being seized by humans.'</p>
<p>"Now what is 'being seized by non-humans'? Herein, bhikkhu, someone lives the holy life with the aspiration [to be born after death] among a certain group of devas. [He aspires:] 'By this virtuous conduct or observance or austerity or holy living may I become a deva or a certain kind of deva.' This is called 'being seized by non-humans.'</p>
<p>"'Being held in a whirlpool' is a designation for the fivefold sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>"Now what is 'rotting from within'? Herein, bhikkhus, someone is immoral, of an evil nature, impure, of dubious behavior, of concealed deeds. Not a recluse, though pretending to be a recluse; not one who lives the holy life, though pretending to be one who does so; rotten within, full of desires, a heap of impurity. This is called 'rotting from within.'"</p>
<p>Now at that time Nanda the cowherd was standing near the Lord... and said: "I, Sir, have not run aground on the near bank. I have not run aground on the far bank, I shall not sink in midstream, I shall not be caught on a sandbank, neither humans nor non-humans shall seize me, I shall not be held in a whirlpool, I shall not rot from within.

<p>"Nanda, you must return the cattle to their owners."</p>
<p>"They will go back by themselves, Sir; the cows are longing for their calves."</p>
<p>"Do return them, Nanda."</p>
<p>Then Nanda the cowherd, having returned the cattle to their owners, approached the Lord... and said: "Sir, the cattle are restored. May I obtain, Sir, the going forth in the Lord's presence, may I obtain full ordination?"</p>
<p>And Nanda the cowherd obtained the going forth in the Lord's presence, obtained full ordination. And not long after his ordination the venerable Nanda, living alone, secluded, diligent, ardent and resolute, soon realized here and now, through his own direct knowledge, that unequaled quest of the holy life... And the venerable Nanda became one of the Perfected Ones.</p>

<p>"Let us suppose, bhikkhus, that there is a king or a king's chief minister who has never heard the sound of a lute (<i>vii.naa</i>). Then, on hearing the sound for the first time, he says: 'Good man, what is that sound, so exciting, so beautiful, so intoxicating, so entrancing, so captivating?'</p>
<p>"And they say to him: 'It is the sound, Sire, of what is called a lute...'</p>
<p>"Thereupon he says: 'Go and bring me that lute.'</p>
<p>"They bring it to him, saying: 'This, Sire, is that lute, the sound of which is so exciting... so captivating.'</p>
<p>"But he rejoins: 'Away with the lute, my man! Just bring me that sound.'</p>
<p>"Then they say to him: 'This which is called a lute, Sire, is made of various parts, a great number of parts. It is because of its various parts, that it makes a sound; that is to say, owing to the belly, sounding board, arm, head, strings, plectrum and the effort of a man's fingers...'</p>
<p>"The king or the king's chief minister then breaks up the lute into ten or a hundred pieces. Having broken it up he splinters it further, burns it in a fire and reduces it to ashes. Having reduced it to ashes he winnows the ashes in a strong wind or lets them be borne away on the swift current of a river. And he says: 'A poor thing is this that you call a lute, my man, whatever the so-called lute may be. People have been infatuated and led astray by it for too long.'</p>
<p>"Just in this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu investigates body as far as body goes; he investigates feeling... perception... mental activities... consciousness as far as consciousness goes. So investigating whatever there may be, there is for him no 'I' or 'mine' or 'I am' in it."</p>

<p>"In this manner, AAnanda, a bhikkhu who is a friend, companion, associate of the good cultivates and seriously practices the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord said: "What, bhikkhus, is the Noble Eightfold Path? It is right view and so forth...</p>

<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is right speech? Whatever is abstention from lying speech, abstention from malicious speech, abstention from harsh speech, abstention from idle speech. This, bhikkhus, is called right speech.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is right action? Whatever is abstention from harming living creatures, abstention from unchastity (<i>abrahmacariyaa</i>). This, bhikkhus, is called right action.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood? Herein, bhikkhus, the noble disciple having given up a wrong livelihood lives his life by means of a right livelihood. This, bhikkhus, is called right livelihood.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is right effort? Herein, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu generates desire, strives, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and struggles to prevent the arising of evil, unskilled states that have not arisen. He generates desire and strives... to be rid of evil, unskilled states that have arisen. He generates desire and strives... to establish and not lose, for the further cultivation, abundance, development and perfection of skilled states that have arisen. This, bhikkhus, is called right effort.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is right mindfulness? Herein, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives practicing body-contemplation on the body, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world. He lives practicing feeling-contemplation on feelings... mind-contemplation on [the states of] mind... mind-object-contemplation on the objects of mind, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world. This, bhikkhus, is called right mindfulness. Now what, bhikkhus, is right concentration? Herein, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, secluded from unskilled things, dwells having entered the first absorption (<i>jhaana</i>), accompanied by thinking and investigation, born of detachment and [filled with] joy and bliss.</p>
<p>"After the subsiding of thinking and investigation and by gaining inner serenity and unification of mind, he dwells having entered the second absorption, which is without thinking and investigation, is born of concentration and [filled with] joy and bliss.</p>
<p>"After the fading away of joy he dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences in his person a bliss of which the Noble Ones say, 'He who has equanimity and is mindful lives blissfully,' and he dwells having entered the third absorption.</p>
<p>"After the abandoning of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and grief, he dwells having entered the fourth absorption which is without pleasure and pain and is purified by equanimity and mindfulness. This, bhikkhus, is called right concentration."</p>

This, bhikkhus, is called the Noble Truth of suffering.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of the origin of suffering?</p>
<p>"It is that craving leading to [renewal of] becoming along with enjoyment and attachment, finding enjoyment now here, now there; namely, sensual craving, the craving for becoming, the craving for non-becoming.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-92' id='fnt-92'>[92]</a> This, bhikkhus, is called the Noble Truth of the origin of suffering.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering?</p>
<p>"It is the complete fading away and cessation of this very craving, the abandoning and rejecting of it, liberation and detachment from it. This, bhikkhus, is called the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>"Now what, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of the way to cessation of suffering?</p>
<p>"It is just this Noble Eightfold Path, that is to say, right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This, bhikkhus, is called the Noble Truth of the way to cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>"These, bhikkhus, are the four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>"Therefore, bhikkhus, to realize, 'This is suffering,' an effort must be made. To realize, 'This is the origin of suffering,' an effort must be made.

	<dd>A <i>devataa</i> (or <i>deva</i>) is an inhabitant of one of the several heavens. The word means "a shining one" and is related to the English words: deity, divinity, etc. The body of a devataa is purer and more subtle than a human being's and radiates light. The period before dawn is the usual time for these beings to visit the Buddha, one of whose titles, it should be remembered, is <i>satthaa devamanussaana.m</i>, the teacher of gods and men.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-2" id="fn-2">2</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The heaven of the Thirty-three Gods (<i>taavati.msa</i>) belongs to the Sensuous Sphere (<i>kaamaavacara</i>) and is ruled over by Sakka (Skt: Indra), their leader. These heavens of the Sensuous Sphere are the reward for good deeds done on earth (see <a href="#passage-14">no. 14</a>). Although a celestial being's life span is much longer than a human being's, they are still subject to death and rebirth.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-3" id="fn-3">3</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Arahants are saints. Here it refers to the Buddhas, the Enlightened Ones or Awakened Ones.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-4" id="fn-4">4</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This is a famous verse which was repeated by Sakka, the Lord of Devas, on the occasion of the Buddha's Passing-away (<i>parinibbaana</i>). See <i>The Wheel</i> No. 67/69, <i>Last Days of the Buddha,</i> p. 77.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-6" id="fn-6">6</a>.</dt>
	<dd>In the discourse preceding this text in the Paali original (not included here), the word "mind" (<i>citta</i>) is substituted for "craving."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-7" id="fn-7">7</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Devaputta</i> means a son of a deva or a young (or new) celestial being. According to the commentary, Kaamada was a bhikkhu in the previous life. He was remorseful for not striving hard enough as a human being and the Buddha is gently chiding him for it.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-8" id="fn-8">8</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"Disciple" stands for the Paali term <i>sekha</i>, "a learner," "one in Higher Training," denoting those who have attained to the first three of the four stages of sanctitude, beginning with stream-entry (<i>sotaapatti</i>). He who has attained the fourth stage, the saint (<i>arahat</i>) is called <i>asekha</i>, "one beyond (the need for) training."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-9" id="fn-9">9</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The Noble Ones (<i>ariyaa</i>) are the Buddhas and their Arahant disciples.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-10" id="fn-10">10</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The Buddha repeats King Pasenadi's reasonings and adds the verses. The whole then becomes a saying of the Buddha.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-12" id="fn-12">12</a>.</dt>
	<dd>In Buddhism a human birth is regarded as the result of former good acts; it is difficult to obtain because few beings have predominantly good kamma and is valuable because it is from here that one may best work for enlightenment.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-15" id="fn-15">15</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Maara, the evil one, is the personification of those things which deflect one from the purpose of gaining Enlightenment. He can either be taken literally or interpreted symbolically. Nevertheless he is a very real obstacle to many when they reach a certain stage in their progress on the path.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-16" id="fn-16">16</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This is the standard definition of the Dhamma as doctrine. It is difficult to reproduce Maara's argument and the reply in translation. There is a play on the meaning of the words <i>kaalika</i> (temporal), translated as "distant," and <i>akaalika</i>, immediate, timeless, or transcendent. Maara is trying to make the monks believe that they are wasting their time, that Nibbaana is something distant and vague, or nonexistent, and not worth bothering about. He is trying to confuse them with his words and also his appearance, for an elderly braahmana should be one to command respect and be an authority on religious matters.</dd>

	<dd>These famous and often quoted verses demonstrate the Buddhist doctrine of <i>anattaa</i>, not-self or impersonality. They avoid the extreme view of nihilism, it is important to note, of which Buddhism is sometimes wrongly accused: it is not a "being" which ceases, but merely suffering &mdash; a subtle difference!</dd>

	<dd>See <a href="#fn-8">Note 8</a>.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-29" id="fn-29">29</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The doctrine of <i>paticca samuppaada</i>, dependent arising, dependent origination, conditioned genesis or co-production, as it is variously rendered in translation, is the central and most profound teaching of Buddhism, and unique to it. It is the key to understanding the Buddha's teaching and one might say that one's depth of understanding of the paticca samuppaada is equivalent to one's depth of understanding of Buddhism. By obtaining at least an intellectual grasp of its principles everything else should automatically fall into place and to have a full understanding of it implies one would be fully Enlightened. Broadly speaking it is the doctrine of the conditionality of all the phenomena of existence, physical, mental and moral. It shows how everything in the universe arises, is supported and passes away dependent upon a variety of conditioning factors, which themselves are likewise dependent upon other factors. Nothing can exist independently, unrelated to and unaffected by the other phenomena in its environment.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-30" id="fn-30">30</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Buddhism, being practical uses this principle specifically to show the origin of suffering and its cessation by the removal of its causative and supportive conditions. For this purpose twelve conditioning factors are enumerated beginning with ignorance and defined in <a href="#passage-17">text 17</a>.
	<p>Traditionally the twelve factors are regarded as spread over the three periods of time or past, present and future lives, and fall into groups as being active or causative and passive or resultant. There are two past active factors, ignorance and volitional activities (factors 1 and 2), giving rise to their results in this life, consciousness, mind-and body, the sixfold sense-field, contact and feeling (factors 3-7). Craving, grasping, and becoming (factors 8 to 10) are the present causative factors with their results in a future life, represented by birth and aging-and-death, etc. (factors 11 and 12). See <i>Dependent Origination</i>, by Piyadassi Thera  (<i>The Wheel</i> No. 15 a/b).</p>
	</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-31" id="fn-31">31</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The word "becoming" is used for the Paali <i>bhava</i>, rather than "being" or "existence." The latter words are too static to bring out the meaning which is essentially dynamic. Perhaps "evolving" might be better. It is the unfolding of the effects of past actions (kamma) and the production of new actions. In Buddhism the universe is classified into three realms: (a) the sensuous realm comprising the hells, the animal, ghost, and human worlds and six heavenly or deva worlds; (b) the form realm, a subtler kind of existence enjoyed by the Brahma-gods; and (c) the formless realm, the beings of which do not have material bodies.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-32" id="fn-32">32</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Siilabbata</i>, an outward show of ritualism and religious observances, such as ritual bathing, fasting, etc., thinking they will bring purity and release of themselves.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-33" id="fn-33">33</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Attavaada</i>: belief in an eternal and unchanging ego-entity, either included in or independent of mind and body.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-34" id="fn-34">34</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>AAyatana</i>, sphere of sense, basis for sensation. There are twelve aayatana altogether: the five sense organs, their respective objects, and the mind, which is regarded as a sense-organ, its object being ideas or thoughts.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-35" id="fn-35">35</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The four great elements or qualities of matter are:
		<ol type="i">
		<li>the earth-element, solidity, extension in space;</li>
		<li>the water-element, cohesion, building matter into mass;</li>
		<li>the fire-element, temperature either hot or cold, maturing;</li>
		<li>the air-element, motion, vibration.</li>
		</ol>
	</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-36" id="fn-36">36</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"Volitional activity" is an interpretative rather than a literal translation of the word <i>sa.nkhaara</i>, an important technical term in Buddhist literature. The word means: formation, construction, determinant; either in the active sense of forming or putting together, or passively as what has been formed, put together or compounded. In this context the first meaning in the sense of active, kammic volitions, is intended.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-37" id="fn-37">37</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Knowledge (<i>&ntilde;aa.na</i>) is the understanding arising from training in meditation. It refers specifically to the knowledge gained on entering one of the stages of sanctity: stream-entry, once-returning, never-returning and <i>arahatta</i> or final emancipation.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-38" id="fn-38">38</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"Tathaagata" is a title of the Buddha. It means, "One who has thus (<i>tathaa</i>) come (<i>aagata</i>) or gone (<i>gata</i>)" to Enlightenment, as former Buddhas have done, or, "One who has arrived at (<i>aagata</i>) the Truth (<i>tatha</i>)." In the Paali scriptures the word is mostly used by the Buddha when referring to himself.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-39" id="fn-39">39</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Uparisaa</i>: support, cause, means, reason, condition, motive.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-40" id="fn-40">40</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Piiti</i>: joy, rapture, ecstasy, thrilling pleasure. It is an important factor that arises in meditation practice.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-41" id="fn-41">41</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Samaadhi</i>: concentration, unification or one-pointedness of mind.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-42" id="fn-42">42</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Nibbidaa</i>: the state of ceasing to be infatuated with conditioned existence</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-43" id="fn-43">43</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Knowledge of exhaustion (<i>khaye-&ntilde;aaya</i>) is the knowledge of final liberation of the Arahant or Perfected One, expressed in the words: "Exhausted (finished) is birth, lived is the holy life, done is what had to be done, there is no more of this or that state" (cf. <a href="#passage-21">no. 21</a>).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-44" id="fn-44">44</a>.</dt>
	<dd>By applying the seven categories to each of the other ten stages of the formula of dependent arising the sources of knowledge total seventy-seven.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-45" id="fn-45">45</a>.</dt>
	<dd>These are the five aggregates (<i>khandhaa</i>) constituting the whole of phenomenal existence (see <a href="#vagga-3">Part Three</a>).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-46" id="fn-46">46</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This discourse refers to the attainment of stream-entry, the first stage of sanctity, where a disciple is unable to fall away and is assured of deliverance. A stream-enterer is born into a state of conditioned existence only seven more times at outside before realizing final liberation.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-47" id="fn-47">47</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Mettaa-bhaavanaa</i>, the meditation on love or friendliness directed impartially towards all living beings, is an important practice in Buddhism. It should be developed whatever other meditation practices are employed and in conjunction with them. The development of this love, as well as the development of faith by contemplating the qualities of the Buddha, etc., is essential in the spiritual life in as much as it gives an outlet to the emotions, directing them away from purely worldly values.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-48" id="fn-48">48</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>A&ntilde;&ntilde;aa</i>: the final knowledge of full liberation of the Arahant.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-49" id="fn-49">49</a>.</dt>
	<dd>These are the five aggregates (<i>khandhaa</i>) or groups constituting the whole of physical and mental existence. The Buddha's analysis of the so-called 'person' or 'being':
		<ol type="i">	
		<li><i>Ruupa</i>, body, form, is the four primary elements (<i>dhaatu</i>): solidity, cohesion, heat and motion, and the corporeal phenomena derived from them.</li>
		<li><i>Vedanaa</i>, feeling, is divided into three types: pleasant, painful and neutral.</li>
		<li><i>Sa&ntilde;&ntilde;aa</i>, perception of sights, sounds, odors, tastes, tangible and mental impressions.</li>
		<li><i> Sankhaaraa</i>, mental activities, include a number of mental concomitants (<i>cetasikaa</i>), fifty-two according to the Abhidhamma, of which the chief is <i>cetanaa</i>: will or volition. It is the same term as is used in the formula of dependent arising, but here the active as well as the passive meaning is intended (see <a href="#fn-36">Note 36</a>).</li>
		<li><i>Vi&ntilde;&ntilde;aa.na</i>, consciousness, cognition, is again divided up according to the senses, as visual-consciousness, auditory-consciousness, etc.</li>
		</ol>
	</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-50" id="fn-50">50</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Impermanence, suffering and not-self (<i>anicca, dukkha, anattaa</i>) are the three marks or characteristics of all conditioned existence.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-51" id="fn-51">51</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The extinction of greed, etc. is, properly speaking, the result of having fully understood or "diagnosed" (<i>pari&ntilde;&ntilde;aata</i>) the body, etc., as being impermanent and so forth.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-52" id="fn-52">52</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Bodhisatta</i> means "Enlightenment-being" or a "being bent upon Enlightenment" and is a term used to describe a person, in this case the man Gotama, before his attainment of full Enlightenment or Buddhahood. It came to be an important term in the later literature of Mahaayaana Buddhism.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-53" id="fn-53">53</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The aggregates as forming the objects of grasping or being grasped at as "a self" or "belonging to a self."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-54" id="fn-54">54</a>.</dt>
	<dd>These are three kinds of heavenly beings.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-55" id="fn-55">55</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Compare this with <a href="#passage-22">no. 22</a> of the previous section.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-56" id="fn-56">56</a>.</dt>
	<dd>There are four <i>aasavaa</i> or taints: sensual desire, becoming, views and ignorance.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-57" id="fn-57">57</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"The seven domains of the Dhamma" are: faith, shame and dread of wrongdoing, truthfulness, strenuous effort, mindfulness and wisdom.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-58" id="fn-58">58</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The "seven jewels" are the seven factors pertaining to Enlightenment (<i>satta-bojjhanga</i>): mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity (see <a href="#passage-67">no. 67</a>).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-59" id="fn-59">59</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The "three trainings" (<i>sikkhaa</i>) are the training in morality, concentration. and wisdom.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-60" id="fn-60">60</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The "ten factors" are the ten powers of a Buddha (<i>tathaagata-balaani</i>) which differentiate him from other beings and even from his own enlightened disciples. He knows according to actuality:
<ol type="i">
<li>causes and conditions and their results;</li>
<li>past, future and present deeds and their results;</li>
<li>the practices leading to good and bad destinies (of beings after death);</li>
<li>the world (of the aggregates, etc.) in all its diversity;</li>
<li>the various (good and bad) dispositions of beings;</li>
<li>the state of the faculties (<i>indriya</i>, of faith, energy, etc.) of other beings;</li>
<li>the attainments in meditation;</li>
<li>his many former births and remembers the various experiences he had in them;</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<ol type="i" start="9">
<li>He sees beings arising and passing away according to their deeds;</li>

<li>through the destruction of the taints (<i>aasavaa</i>) he dwells in freedom of mind (<i>cetavimutti</i>) and freedom through wisdom (<i>pa&ntilde;&ntilde;aa-vimutti</i>).</li>
</ol>
<p>All are enumerated fully in Majjhima Nikaaya, sutta 12.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-61" id="fn-61">61</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The "triple conceit" consists of the thoughts 'I am better,' 'I am inferior,' 'I am equal' (the feeling of superiority, inferiority, and the insistence to be equal).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-62" id="fn-62">62</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Alternatively, "They activate within a conditioned complex..." This is a very difficult phrase. According to the commentary, <i>cetanaa</i> (volition) is prominent here in the meaning of <i>sankhaaraa </i>(activities) in its function of coordinating, organizing and directing. Cetanaa thus integrates the five aggregates together into an evanescent whole and directs and coordinates their various functions.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-63" id="fn-63">63</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"Consumed" means "suffering discomfort." "As a person clad in a filthy robe suffers discomfort and says, 'The robe eats me' so does body and the other aggregates cause one discomfort" (Commentary).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-64" id="fn-64">64</a>.</dt>
	<dd>He conquers the world, i.e., the five aggregates, by penetrating with his perfect wisdom their true nature as impermanent and so forth.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-65" id="fn-65">65</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Unsullied by craving and attachment to the world.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-66" id="fn-66">66</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>AAdiccabandhu</i>, "Kinsman of the Sun," is another epithet of the Buddha and refers to his royal descent, but see also <a href="#passage-78">no. 78</a>.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-67" id="fn-67">67</a>.</dt>
	<dd>They are diversified by the results of kamma, volitional acts of mind.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-68" id="fn-68">68</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The five aggregates are produced (and reproduced) by kamma.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-69" id="fn-69">69</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Sabba.m</i>: the whole, everything that is, the totality of experience.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-70" id="fn-70">70</a>.</dt>
	<dd>There are the twelve sense-bases (<i>aayatana</i>), six internal (subjective), the sense organs; and six external (objective), the corresponding sense objects. These present an analysis of experience complementary to that of the aggregates.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-71" id="fn-71">71</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The three knowledges (<i>te vijjaa</i>) are: i) recollection of former existences; (ii) divine vision (<i>dibba cakkhu</i>) or seeing other beings arising and passing away according to their deeds, good or bad; and (iii) knowledge of the extinction of the aasavas or taints. The possession of these three knowledges means one is an Arahant or Perfected One.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-72" id="fn-72">72</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The attainment of final release (<i>parinibbuta</i>) is a term for the death of a Perfected One, who does not grasp at another birth. Ordinarily death is merely the prelude to another birth.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-73" id="fn-73">73</a>.</dt>
	<dd>In this discourse heaven and hell are presented as two extremes of experience, partial and incomplete. It is only as a human being when both pleasure and pain are known, that existence can be viewed objectively and wholly. Hence only in a human birth can the religious or "holy" life (<i>brahmacariya</i>) be lived it and is a great "opportunity" for spiritual progress.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-74" id="fn-74">74</a>.</dt>
	<dd>All, except those who are Perfected Ones, according to the commentary.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-75" id="fn-75">75</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This is probably an idiomatic phrase or a popular quote.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-76" id="fn-76">76</a>.</dt>
	<dd>These are the four elements (<i>dhaatu</i>) composing the body. When one or another of these elements becomes out of balance ("disturbed and angry") the body becomes sick and dies.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-77" id="fn-77">77</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The floods (<i>oghaa</i>) are identical with the taints (<i>aasavas</i>) mentioned earlier.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-78" id="fn-78">78</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The existence-group (<i>sakkaaya</i>) is a term for the group of mental and physical factors, impermanent and subject to suffering, constituting an individual existence.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-79" id="fn-79">79</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The noble disciple has control over his mind. As he has had a realization of the Four Noble Truths, he knows that pain is an exemplification of the first Noble Truth and is the result of past kamma (deeds). If he reacts to it in the way ordinary man does, this would merely be accumulating more kamma with its result in the future.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-80" id="fn-80">80</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"Dhamma" is a word of several meanings. Here besides meaning "the teaching of...," it could also mean: "the virtuous nature or conduct of...," "the (inspiring) ideal of those bhikkhus." All these meanings of the term "dhamma" may be taken into consideration.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-81" id="fn-81">81</a>.</dt>
	<dd>These seven factors of enlightenment (<i>satta-bojjhanga</i>): mindfulness, reality-investigation (see <a href="#fn-82">following note</a>), energy, joy, tranquility, concentration and equanimity, are, according to SN 46. 5, so called because "they lead to enlightenment" (<i>bodhaaya sa.mvattanti</i>), or else they are the constituent factors (<i>a.nga</i>) of enlightenment (<i>bodhi</i>) itself.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-82" id="fn-82">82</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Dhamma-vicaya</i>. The term <i>dhamma</i> here does not refer to the Buddha's Teaching, but to the mental and physical phenomena (<i>dhammaa</i>) presented to the mind in their real nature (i.e., without emotional coloring, likes and dislikes, etc.) through the cultivation of mindfulness.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-83" id="fn-83">83</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Orambhaagiya-sa.myojana</i>: the five fetters belonging to the lower, the sensual realms of existence, these being:
<ol type="i">
<li><i>Sakkaaya-di.t.thi</i> &mdash; views about the "existing group" of mental and physical phenomena (i.e., the five aggregates), that they constitute a "self" or a "person" or an "ego" thought of as being permanent or existing in unbroken continuity from the past into the future;</li>
<li><i>Vicikicchaa</i> &mdash; wavering doubt;</li>
<li><i>Siilabbata-paraamaasa</i> &mdash; holding to habits and customs, mere external observances, thinking they will bring release of themselves;</li>
<li><i>Kaamaraaga</i> &mdash; sensual passions and attachments;</li>
<li><i>Vyaapaada</i> &mdash; ill-will, aversion.</li>
</ol>

<p>A person who has eliminated these five fetters is called an <i>anaagaamii</i>, a never-returner. After death he does not come back again to this world, but is born in one of the five Pure Abodes (<i>Suddhaavaasa</i>) of the realm of form (<i>ruupaloka</i>) and there realizes final deliverance. The last five of these seven fruits refer to the five grades of anaagaamii in descending order, the highest is "one who attains final deliverance early," down to the "one going upstream."</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-84" id="fn-84">84</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Akani.t.thaagaamii</i>: bound for the gods (<i>devaa</i>) of the highest of the Pure Abodes. This is the lowest of the five types of <i>anaagaamii</i> who, starting from the lowest, has to work his way through all five Pure Abodes before attaining final deliverance.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-85" id="fn-85">85</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The four <i>satipa.t.thaanaa</i> or foundations of mindfulness are most important and the basis of all the meditation practices leading to liberation found within Buddhism. In its stress upon <i>sati</i> (mindfulness, attentiveness, awareness or recollection), and in its detailed instruction, Buddhism is unique. Its importance is emphasized here by its being described as "the sole way" (the "one," the "only," the "direct way," <i>ekaayano</i>).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-86" id="fn-86">86</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Besides meaning awareness in the present, in the here and now, mindfulness also has the secondary meaning of memory.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-87" id="fn-87">87</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Saariputta calls it "this impressive speech" (literally "bull-like utterance," <i>aasabhii-vaacaa</i>) for it is the Ven. Anuruddha's declaration of having attained the status of a Perfected One.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-88" id="fn-88">88</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Faith (<i>saddhaa</i>) or confidence (<i>pasaada</i>) in Buddhism is not mere belief in something or someone, but arises upon the attachment of (spiritual) knowledge and realization, the vision of the goal &mdash; Nibbaana.  A noble disciple is a person who has obtained this knowledge by entering upon one of the Noble Paths, of stream-entry, once-returning, never-returning and arahant. The "four things" are also called the "four factors of stream-entry" (<i>sotaapattiyanga</i>). A stream-enterer is liable to be born seven times at the most, either in the human world or one of the heavens, but never lower than human (e.g., in hell, the animal state, etc.), before attaining final deliverance.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-89" id="fn-89">89</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The attainment of one on the Noble Path (which is a <i>kamma</i>, a willed action) is immediately followed by its fruit (result).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-90" id="fn-90">90</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The "four pairs" are those who have attained to the path of stream-entry and the fruit of stream-entry (<i>sotaapatti-magga</i>, <i>sotaapatti-pala</i>) and similarly for the other three, making the "eight persons."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-91" id="fn-91">91</a>.</dt>
	<dd>In SN 47. 48 a similar exhortation is found, substituting the four foundations of mindfulness for the four factors of stream-entry.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-92" id="fn-92">92</a>.</dt>
	<dd>These last two forms of craving are: the desire for the perpetuation of existence and for self annihilation, and are connected with the two extreme views of eternalism (<i>sassata-di.t.thi</i>), belief in the continuation of a "self" or "soul" after death, and annihilation (<i>ucceheda-di.t.thi</i>), belief that the personality, identified with the five aggregates, ceases completely after death.</dd>
