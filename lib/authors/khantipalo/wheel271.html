[SUMMARY]={One of the most deeply rooted deceptions in the mind is its tendency to identify the body as "self." Recognizing that this seductive but distorted view of reality can be a stubborn impediment to progress in the Dhamma, the Buddha taught his students some practices and reflections specifically designed to undercut this illusion. This book is a marvelous anthology of many of these teachings, taken from the Pali canon and related texts, plus many more from the author's own writings. <b>Caution:</b> The readings in this book are very powerful, and are probably not suitable for beginning meditators. To paraphrase the author's comments in the Introduction: <i>Meditation on the unattractiveness of the body should be practiced with moderation and care, especially if one has no personal contact with a meditation teacher.</i>}

<h2><a id='intro'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>The body is thought to be most obviously "me," what I regard as the most tangible part of myself. Around it therefore are constructed many views, all of them distorted to some extent, which prevent insight arising into <i>the body as it really is</i>. This book is a small anthology relating to the body in various ways, and presents material which, if contemplated by the earnest and sincere student of Dhamma, will eventually provide fruitful insight and, thereby, freedom from the many desires and fears centered on the body.</p>

<p>Such desires for pleasures in which the body is the instrument (though it is in the heart-mind where they dwell), awaken and intensify greed of all kinds, for food or sex for instance. Greed which is often accompanied by pleasurable sensations &mdash; and therefore desired &mdash; needs a rather bitter medicine to combat it: hence the number of pieces here on the unattractiveness of the body, its decay and death &mdash; all unpleasant matters. Some of the material, concerned with bodily unattractiveness, is like a medicine which need only be taken while the disease of greed-lust is active, and afterwards may be discontinued. It is important to understand this, and not to form the mistaken impression that the Buddha advocated viewing all beauty as loathsome. It is only that there is a hook in beauty which tangles with the greed in one's own heart and leads to more and more complications and difficulties.</p>

<p>Fears center around aging-decay, disease and death. They are not overcome by pretending they do not exist, as the ostrich is said to bury its head in the sand at the approach of enemies. Only resolutely facing these inevitable features of life can bring insight and relief from fear.</p>

<p>The Buddha's instructions on contemplation of the body are addressed to those who are able, through their life-style, to practice them. This means in effect monks and nuns, together with dedicated lay people. The former group have this contemplation given to them by their Teachers at the time of Going-forth from home to homelessness, and they need such a medicine to combat lust, which is destructive to the celibate Holy Life. Lay people keeping the Five Precepts have contentment with their partners as an important part of their practice. Sex is a natural part of their life but should still be restrained and kept within the bounds of the Third Precept. If not, how much trouble follows! But some of them may wish to live without sexual attachment, and this cannot be done in the way of Dhamma by ignoring the power of the sexual drive, or by suppressing it. Only when it is treated with mindfulness can it be transcended. The aspect of mindfulness which is needed for this is the subject, or rather the interrelated subjects of this book.</p>

<p>In the world today people are subjected to a bombardment of sensuality by way of the mass media. Sex especially is used as a bait to sell things, and as a titillation of sensory experience. When this subjection is continued, the defilements of the mind, notably lust, greed, and attachment, are sure to be strengthened. Then when this has happened the result is not more happiness, only an increase of dukkha, suffering, trouble, and difficulties. The medicine for such over-indulgence and over-stimulation is given in this book.</p>

<p>It is said that this subject of meditation is unique to the Buddha's Teachings and that elsewhere it is not clearly taught. This is not surprising as we find that desire is sometimes accepted as being "natural." Wherever desires are viewed as "natural," that is, inherent in one's nature or self, nothing much can be done about them. But the Buddha analyzed desires into those which are wholesome &mdash; to practice Dhamma, for instance &mdash; and the unwholesome ones, among which are greed and lust. They may not be gross either, as in the case of the meditator who is greedy for bliss, or visions, and attached to such things. The Buddha has provided the medicine for all unwholesome desires, and according to our various ways of life we can use it to effect partial or complete cures.</p>

<p>When the emphasis is so much on sensuality, youth, and beauty as we find now, the darker sides of life get pushed away and attempts are made, always unsuccessful, to sweep them under the carpet. Those who try to do so will not be pleased with the exercises contained in the Buddha's contemplation of the body. Such things will appear to them as morbid and unnatural. Yet they are also a part of this life and should not be ignored. And if the effort is made to ignore what is unpleasant about the body, sooner or later one will be jolted into the recognition of these things. Such jolts are not pleasant. Rather than leave it until one is forced to know the body's unpleasant sides it is better to acquaint one's emotions with this knowledge gradually.</p>

<p>In this spirit, <i>Bag of Bones</i> is being published. Unfortunately, being only a book it cannot give person-to-person advice on special problems. It can only offer some general guidelines to people who are interested in reducing their greed and lust. <i>A word of warning:</i> meditation on the unattractiveness of the body can be very potent and should only be practiced with moderation and care, especially if one has no personal contact with a Teacher of Buddhist meditation. If fear and anxiety, or other extreme unwholesome emotional states arise after practice of it, then it will be better to lay it down and take up Loving-kindness <i>(metta)</i> or Recollection of the Buddha <i>(Buddhanussati)</i> as one's meditation instead.</p>

<p>This book, therefore, is not so much for beginners in Buddhism but rather for those who have already practiced for some time. May it inspire many people to practice the Dhamma more intently!</p>

<p>Translations which have no one's name after them are by the compiler. And all other reflections, dialogues, and poems too are his work, and have been jotted down as they occurred to him, mostly in the peaceful Forest Hermitage of Ven. Nyanaponika Mahathera outside Kandy. May I also here acknowledge the venerable Mahathera's kind advice and help in bringing this collection to print.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, when <i>one dhamma</i> is developed and cultivated it leads to a great sense of urgency, to great benefit, to great safety from bondage, to great mindfulness and full awareness, to obtainment of knowledge and insight, to a pleasant abiding here and now, to realization of the fruit of true knowledge and deliverance.

<li>One obtains all four jhanas,</li>

<li>The heavenly ear element (clairaudience),</li>
<li>Knowledge of others' minds,</li>
<li>And of all one's past lives,</li>

<p>You live by <i>"following the body"?</i> Eating when it's hungry, resting when it's tired, dressing when necessary, urinating, defecating, going to work to get money &mdash; all for what? For this body? Then what about the time when its end comes? What was it all for?</p></div>

<p>"Now the pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on that beauty and loveliness are the gratification in the case of form.</p>

<p>"And what is danger in the case of form?</p>

Black was my hair, the color of bees, curled at the ends;
with aging it's likened to fibers of hemp &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> words.

Fragrant was my hair, full of flowers like a perfume box;
with aging it possesses the smell of dog's fur &mdash;

Thick as a well-planted grove and comely with comb, pin and parting;
with aging it's thin here and there &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Braided well, adorned, black masses beautified by gold;
with aging has the head become quite bald &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

My eyebrows then as though by artists were well-drawn;
with aging they are wrinkled, hanging down &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Flashing and brilliant as jewels, black and long were my eyes;
by aging overwhelmed no longer beautiful &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Long, beautiful and delicate my nose in the bloom of my youth;
with aging has become quite pendulous &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Fair my earlobes, formerly as bracelets well and truly crafted;
with aging they are wrinkled, hanging down &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Then were my teeth beautiful, the hue of plantain buds;
with aging they have broken and yellowed &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Sweet was my singing voice as cuckoo in the forest grove;
with aging it is broken now and then &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Formerly my throat was beautiful, polished like a conch;
with aging decayed it is and twisted &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Round as door-bars then were my arms beautiful;
with aging they are weak as the trumpet-creeper &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Adorned with gold and delicate signet rings my hands were beautiful;
with aging just like knotted and twisted roots &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Full and round were my breasts, close together, lovely and lofty;
pendulous they hang now as water-skins without water &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Fair was my body then as a well-burnished tablet of gold;
now it is covered all over with very fine wrinkles &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Lovely both my thighs as the trunks of elephants;
with aging they are as a bamboo's stems &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

Fair were my legs adorned with fine golden anklets;
with aging stick-like as the sesame &mdash;
not other than this are the Truth-speaker's words.

As though filled out with down my feet so lovely;
with aging they are cracked and wrinkled &mdash;

So was this congeries; decrepit now, abode of dukkha;

<p>Contemplation of the body's unattractiveness is not a popular meditation. People are happy to try to rid themselves of anger and hatred because they are painful.

<div class="excerpt">
<p>When desires connected with bodily pleasures can be indulged, which means that <i>greed</i> rules the mind, <i>aversion</i> only arises if one's aims are thwarted; but when a person has undertaken some method of self-discipline not guided by wisdom (<i>pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a</i>), then suppressed desires find their outlet not only by aversion but also by bodily mortification. As though the body was responsible! So, having no wisdom, people subject their bodies to "disciplines" and rigors of various kinds in order, they think, <i>to control strong desires.</i> Then <i>aversion</i>, that is self-hatred in a more or less subtle form, reigns supreme and sufferings are increased. Desires can never be understood in this way, only suppressed. The only way to understand desires is through mindfulness, and the various exercises on mindfulness of the body are for this purpose.</p>

Wise men want to be cured of this disease and the Buddha offers for this the medicine of contemplating the unattractive in one's own body. One should not try to see the ugly or foul in others. This could turn to hatred &mdash; even if not, it could result in a "sour grapes" attitude to them. Towards others maintain one of the Divine Abidings: loving-kindness, compassion, joy-with-others, or equanimity, but towards one's own selfish desires for pleasure develop the seeing of unattractiveness.</p></div>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>There is no unhealthy self-disgust or aversion here, just seeing what is unattractive as it really is. But in later times some teachers (such as Shantideva in his Bodhicaryavatara)<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> went to extremes in this matter.

<div class="excerpt">
<p>It is a remarkable thing that the first five parts on this list &mdash; the "person" we see &mdash; are all dead! Hair of the head and body lives only at its roots, we see dead hair. Nails that we see are dead nails, the quick is painful and hidden. The teeth, all that is visible, are dead, and their tender living roots we only experience painfully from time to time. Outer skin is dead &mdash; horrible if it was not, for it is sensitive enough already. The living skin below is more painful.</p>

<p>So when we get excited about a visual form &mdash; someone else's body &mdash; we are stimulated by impressions of what has died already. Strange to be excited by what is dead on the outside and dying within! However, the real lure is in our own minds: the thoughts of lust that arise there and embellish the corpse before us.</p>

<p>Apart from this, live bodies and dead ones differ only in degree. Lust fastens only on the body. But loving-kindness and compassion are concerned with the well-being of peoples' minds and bodies.</p>

<div class="excerpt verse">
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
Walking or standing, sitting, lying down,
He bends it in or stretches it: this is the body's movement.
This body by bones and sinews bound, bedaubed with membrane, flesh,
And covered up with skin &mdash; is not seen as it really is.
Filled with guts, with belly filled with liver-lump and bladder,
With heart, with lungs as well, with kidneys and with spleen,
With snot and spittle, and with fat and sweat,
With blood, and oil for the joints, with bile, and grease of the skin;
Then by nine streams the unclean flows forever from it:
Eye-dirt from the eyes, ear-dirt from the ears,
Snot from the nose, now from the mouth bile is spewed,
Now is spewed out phlegm, and from the body sweat and dirt.
And then its hollow head is stuffed with brains;
The fool thinks (all is) beautiful &mdash; led on by ignorance.
But when it's lying dead, bloated up and livid blue,
Cast away in the charnel ground, even kin do not care for it.
Dogs eat it and jackals, and wolves and worms,
Crows and vultures eat it, and whatever other creatures are.
Wise the bhikkhu in this world who having heard the Buddha-word,
The body he knows surely and thoroughly, he sees it as it really is,
(Thinking): As this (living body) so that (corpse was once),
As that (corpse is now) so this (body will surely be) &mdash;
So for the body, within and without, discard desire.
Such a bhikkhu, wise, discarding desire and lust in this world,
Attains to deathlessness, to peace, Nibbana the unchanging state.
Pampered is this foul, two-footed, fetid thing,
Though filled with various sorts of stench and oozing here and there:
He who with such a body thinks to exalt himself,
Or should despise another &mdash; what else is this but blindness?

<div class="excerpt">
<p>A drum has four characteristics &mdash; it is round in section, covered by hide, is beaten frequently, and emits sound. In the same way the body has four characteristics: it is round in section or fairly much so, it also is covered by hide, it is beaten by the many sorts of physical and mental dukkha, and emits sound &mdash; that is, the sounds indicating pleasure which is unreliable and impermanent, and those which accompany sufferings such as weeping and lamentation.

<div class="excerpt">
<p>The Buddha said:</p>

<p>"Birth is dukkha,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-13' id='fnt-13'>[13]</a> disease is dukkha, decay is dukkha, death is dukkha" &mdash; all this is dukkha related to this body. It is interesting that each sort of dukkha has special institutions in Western society to screen it off from the generality of people, who are "in between" these events so to speak. Birth takes place in maternity wards and nursing homes. Other parts of the same hospital take care of "disease." For "decay" we have old peoples' homes and the geriatric wards, while "death" may occur in all such places, the corpse then going on to the undertakers' chapels, and to religious rites. Things hidden away are unhealthy. Look at the dukkha! Look at it!</p>

<h2><a id="passage-58">&sect;58</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>There is so much dukkha connected with this body, which people never notice due to shifting around from one position to another. When tired of walking or standing, they sit down; when tired of sitting, they stand or lie down; when they have enough of lying down, they get up. Walking an unexpectedly long distance is dukkha. Standing long in queue is dukkha. Sitting in even a comfortable chair for hours is dukkha. Lying in a hospital bed for days or weeks is dukkha. By changing position we evade the dukkha, or make it less obvious. But when someone starts to meditate, spending hours on walking meditation, hours on sitting meditation &mdash; then this bodily dukkha can be felt and investigated.</p>

<h2><a id="passage-59">&sect;59</a> Pain and the Body</h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"The uninstructed ordinary person, bhikkhu, has a saying: 'There is a bottomless abyss in the great ocean.' But the uninstructed ordinary person speaks of what does not exist, of what cannot be found, that is that there is a bottomless abyss in the great ocean. A designation for painful bodily feeling, bhikkhus, is this term 'bottomless abyss.' When an uninstructed ordinary person experiences painful bodily feeling, he grieves, is afflicted laments, beats his breast, cries out loud and becomes distraught. So it is said, bhikkhus, the uninstructed ordinary person has not emerged from the bottomless abyss, has not obtained a firm foothold.</p>

<p>"But, bhikkhus, when an instructed Noble Disciple experiences painful bodily feeling he does not grieve, is not afflicted, does not lament, nor beat his breast, nor cry out loud, nor become distraught. So it is said, bhikkhus, the instructed Noble Disciple has emerged from the bottomless abyss and has obtained a firm foothold."</p>

<pre>
Earth and water elements inside
press to get out,
all that solid food, and drink
ingested, must be in time extruded.
No polished "sanitary ware"
adorns my forest loo
all natural
a wooden platform raised upon a pit.
Where I walk up and down
pacing steadily to still the mad mind,
at the end surrounded by trees &mdash;
my lovely loo.
Trees with asbestos sheeting broken up
nailed to the trunks &mdash; for privacy,
where only trees can watch
bored &mdash; but nourished &mdash; by this necessity.
To climb up to my toilet
six feet up swaying with the trunks
of trees, two logs are driven in the ground
as steps up to the throne.

A platform with a hole
through which one can look down
ten feet to the papered pit below
and watch the great black dung-
beetles at work burying the mess,
hygienic from our point of view
but what a birth to get,
perhaps for perverters and pornographers?
Anyway, I squat lordly far above
while water and earth elements within
join water and earth elements without.
when within I call them "mine";
when in the pit they're not me &mdash;
where does the change take place?
Strange mind which loves this stinking form
But loathes the stink down there.
Rejoicing in fine flavors,
Detesting stench and excrement:
"I" am made up of all this
rejoicing and detesting.

<p>R. Well, I see it &mdash; every day for years.</p>

<p>B. So it's yours because you see it?</p>

<p>R. Yes. Besides, I feel it's mine.</p>

<p>B. O.K. So that's another reason why it belongs to you. You feel it &mdash; right?</p>

<p>R. Sure! It feels like me.</p>

<p>B. Any other evidence that it's yours? What about the other senses?</p>

<p>R. I suppose you could say that I hear it too. My guts gurgle and my feet thump the deck. Of course it smells like me too. Taste? Oh I don't think that helps identify it very much. So that's all the senses, and they tell me that it is mine.</p>

<p>B. You've left out the most important sense &mdash; the mind. That tells you "this is my body" all the time...</p>

<p>R. Yes, if you want to call mind a sense. Yes, it identifies what is mine and what is not.</p>

<p>B. Well, I don't think it is so easy to tell what is one's own and what is not.</p>

<p>R. Can't do that, you know. It's not natural!</p>

<p>B. Well now, what is natural? And does power over a thing signify ownership? For instance, that bit of dead wood over there. Is it myself?</p>

<p>R. Oh, come on... of course not!</p>

<p>B. But it's quite natural, and one can do nothing about making it live again. When it lived, that life was conditioned by many factors, now it's dead because of those factors' change. Yet you say "my body"!</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>Here life's for mortals, wretched and brief, unknown its end; incalculable and 'tis to dukkha joined.</p>

<p>That those who are born will never die no means are there indeed!</p>

<p>Having reached decay there's death, thus is the law for beings.</p>

<p>As for fruit that is ripe there's always fear of falling so for mortals who are born there's always fear of death.</p>

<p>Just as vessels made of clay by a maker of pots all end by being broken, so death is (the end) of life.</p>

<p>The young and those who're great in age, the fools together with the wise, all go under the sway of death, for all death is the goal.</p>

<p>Those who are overcome by death and going to another world, the father cannot protect his son, nor relatives their kin.</p>

<p>While relatives are watching, weeping and lamenting, see mortal beings one by one led as an ox to slaughter.</p>

<p>As the world is thus afflicted by death and by decay, therefore the wise grieve not knowing the nature of the world.</p>

<p>Their path you do not know by which they come, by which they go.</p>

<p>Neither end is seen by you, useless your lament!</p>

<p>If then by lamenting benefits were obtained then the wise would do so, a fool just hurts himself.</p>

<p>Not by crying nor by grief the mind attains to peace but still more dukkha is produced, the body as well is harmed.</p>

<p>One becomes both pale and thin &mdash; one merely hurts oneself, not thus are the dead protected, it's useless to lament!</p>

<p>By not forsaking grief one goes to greater dukkha, bewailing those who've died, one's in the sway of grief.</p>

<p>See other men who go along, go according to kamma, so beings tremble here with fear come under the sway of death.</p>

<p>However they conceive it, it's quite other than that, just so is separation &mdash; see the nature of the world!</p>

<p>Though one lived for hundred years or even more, such a man is separated from his kin and here he leaves his life.</p>

<p>So having heard the arahats, give up your lamentation.</p>

<p>Seeing the corpse (one should think): "He'll not be met by me again."</p>

<p>As a burning house with water should be extinguished,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-17' id='fnt-17'>[17]</a> so one wise and steadfast, a man who's wise in wholesomeness quickly is rid of arisen grief as wind a tuft of down.</p>

<p>One who desires his own happiness: let him pull out his own arrow &mdash; lamentations and longings, the grief that's in himself.</p>

<p>Arrow withdrawn, unattached, the mind attains to peace, passed beyond all grief, griefless and extinguished.</p>

<pre>
Short indeed is this life &mdash;
within a hundred years one dies,
and if anyone lives longer
then he dies of decay.
People grieve for what is "mine":
indeed possessions are not permanent
and this is subject to destruction &mdash;
see this and homeless dwell!
In death it is abandoned
yet man thinks "it is mine."
Knowing this, the wise man devoted to me
should not stoop down to making "his own."
As a man awake sees not
the things he met in sleep,
so too the one beloved is not seen
having departed and done his time.
People now are seen and heard
and thus are called by name,
but alone shall the name remain
for the departed to be spoken of.
The greedy in "mine"-making do not give up
sorrow, lamentation, avarice
therefore sages leaving possessions
have wandered about, Seers of the Secure.

For a bhikkhu practicing seclusion,
keeping company with the secluded mind,
all are agreed and say of him
"He should not show himself again in becoming!"
The sage is unsupported in all circumstances,
nothing he makes dear nor what is not dear,
sorrow and avarice stain him not,
just as water stays not upon a leaf.
As a water-drop upon a lotus plant,
as water does not stain a lotus flower,
even so the sage is never stained
by what has been seen, heard and sensed by him.
Certainly the wise man does not conceive
by what has been seen, heard and sensed,
nor through another does he wish for purity
for he is not attached nor yet is he displeased.

<h2><a id="passage-80">&sect;80</a> The Arahat Ratthapala Thera's Verses Addressed To The Aged King Koravya</h2>
<div class="excerpt verse">
<pre>
I see men wealthy in the world, who yet
Give not, from ignorance, their gatheren riches;
But greedily will hoard away their wealth,
Through longing for still further sensual pleasures.
A king who has by force conquered the earth
And even lords the land the ocean bounds
Is yet unsated with the sea's near shore
And hungers for its further shore as well.
Most men as well, not just a king,
Encounter death with craving unabated;
With plans still incomplete they leave the corpse;
Desires remain unsated in the world.
His relatives lament him, rend their hair,
Crying "Ah me! Alas! Our love is dead!",
Then bear away the body wrapped in shrouds
To place it on a pyre and burn it there
Clad in a single shroud, he leaves behind
His property, and prodded with stakes he burns,
And as he died, no relative or kin
Or friends could offer refuge to him here.
The while his heirs annex his wealth, this being
Must now pass on according to his kammas;
And as he dies no thing can follow him:
Nor child nor wife nor wealth nor royal estate.

Longevity is not acquired with wealth
Nor can prosperity banish old age;
Short is this life, as all the sages say,
Eternity it knows not, only change.
The rich man and the poor man both shall feel
(Death's) touch, as do the fool and sage alike;
But while the fool lie stricken by his folly,
No sage will ever tremble at the touch.
Better is understanding, then, whereby
The goal can here be gained, than any wealth;
For men through different lives in ignorance
Do evil, while they fail to reach the goal.
As one goes to the womb and the next world,
Renewing the successive round, so another
With no more understanding, trusting him,
Goes also to the womb and the next world.
Just as robber caught in burglary
By his own kamma's marked a miscreant,
So people after death, in the next world
By their own kammas marked are they as miscreants.
For sense-desires so mind-alluring, sweet.
In many a different way disturb the mind;
Seeing the danger in these sense-desires
So I went forth to homelessness, O king.

<p>B. What do you mean?</p>

<p>A. The body is going to die. It's only you dying if you identify the body as yourself.</p>

<p>B. That's a good thought. Then I am not going to die. I shall live for ever!</p>

<p>A. Can do, if that's what you want! But think of the sufferings, born and dying, again and again.</p>

<p>B. How do I get out of it?</p>

<p>A. Just as you don't identify with the body, so you try not identifying with the mind.</p>

<p>B. Wow! How come! Impossible! <i>I</i> don't identify with <i>my</i> mind. There's only one <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>A. Suppose you see no <i>me</i>, suppose there is just emptiness, and no <i>me</i> perceiving it, what then?</p>

<p>B. Oh!</p>

<h2><a id="passage-84">&sect;84</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Interesting that religions (all of them) concern themselves so much with the dead <i>bodies.</i> Ceremonies of various sorts are all conducted round the lifeless lumps of decaying flesh. Yet each religion is concerned really with whatever is thought of as continuing. It shows that attachment to <i>the body as the person'</i> is very strong.</p>

<p>And in English we talk of "the dead" as opposed to "the living." But for a Buddhist there are no dead people, only decaying bodies. Paradoxically, a person, while not rid of the concept of personality, never dies.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="passage-85">&sect;85</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Villagers in Buddhist countries are often better schooled in the body and its end than are educated Westerners. The former have plenty of chances to go to the local temple, or to see the nearest meditation teacher. And what do they hear? Again and again they hear the sound of ANICCA, DUKKHA, ANATTA<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-19' id='fnt-19'>[19]</a> of all parts of the human being, mind and body. By hearing frequently it sinks in, so that even if people never penetrate these Three Marks of Existence in themselves, at least they have an attitude of accepting them to some extent. It helps with decay, disease, and death. And they see friends and kin cremated, not in a posh chapel with soft music, solemn colors and concealed oven, but on top of a pile of logs in the forest. That's the body burning &mdash; there's that smell of meat...and this body too will go the same way.</p>

<p>These things are good to see. They are healthy, wholesome. There is no false solemnity, things are just the way they are. Undisguised.</p>
</div>
<h2><a id="passage-86">&sect;86</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>People in Buddhist lands who have so often heard teaching about ANICCA, impermanence, are more ready to accept the common end than a great many Westerners. Old age, disease and death are better accepted by Buddhists as just as natural a part of life as birth. One does not bewail the birth of a child &mdash; though painful enough for both mother and child &mdash; so why bewail the naturally succeeding events? Buddhists who know the Dhamma well talk naturally and calmly about their old age and death as they have contemplated as ANICCA everything in this (and any other) world.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="passage-87">&sect;87</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>There is nothing like living in a little hut in the tropical forest to make one realize how vulnerable this body is to all sorts of attack. How very small creatures can make life difficult if not precarious for this body. A city-dweller misses most of this and may easily get a false sense of security. (All those neat little suburban houses in regular rows...)</p>

<p>Another thing which life in the wilds makes really necessary is mindfulness. Mindfulness where one puts one's feet, specially in the dark. And then one cannot get on without loving-kindness too, since all sorts of other beings are so near to oneself, near to this body which one fears for. Loving-kindness rids one of such fears and hatreds.</p>
</div>
<h2><a id="passage-88">&sect;88</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>We have so many fears &mdash; all things out there &mdash; ghosts, darkness, unknown people, loneliness, and so on. The really fearful things, this mind-and-body's precarious state, we never see.</p>

<h2><a id="passage-89">&sect;89</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>The body has a side which most of us don't want to see and know. We wish to hush up its dirt, stinks, belches and farts, to disregard and overlook them. Yet finally when laid low and near to death, these stenches and filths can be disguised no longer.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="passage-90">&sect;90</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>It is a salutary lesson, if one gets the chance, to go to an autopsy and watch the doctors and nurses pulling a body to pieces. One's eyes are not prepared for this sight even if one has watched a butcher chopping up meat. And one's nose can well be assaulted too by the overpowering stench of decay if the corpse is just a few days old. To see this is to experience for oneself some Dhamma: how the body is just conditioned and decaying bits and pieces. "As this body is, so that body was; as that body is, so this body will be."</p>

<p>Lists like the following ten stages of the body's decay are often illustrated in traditional Buddhist art, in ancient books and on temple walls, as often seen in Thailand. These are like special prescriptions for the disease of lust:</p>
<ul>
<li>a bloated corpse (cures attachment to shapeliness)</li>
<li>a discolored corpse (cures attachment to color and complexion)</li>
<li>a festering corpse (cures attachment to bodily smell and fine perfumes)</li>
<li>a gnawn-by-animals corpse (cures attachment to greed for fleshy protuberances)</li>
<li>a scattered corpse (cures attachment to gracefulness of limbs)</li>
<li>a bleeding corpse (cures attachment to decoration of the body with ornaments)</li>
<li>a worm-infested corpse (cures attachment to body as one's own)</li>
<li>a skeleton held together by sinews (cures attachment to fine bone structure)</li>
<li>scattered bones (cures attachment to body as "one thing")</li>

<div class="excerpt verse">
<pre>
This body lying in decay
To worms and flies unconscious prey,
Bereft of mind and animation
Portrays man's final situation.
Engendered in a human womb,
A fabric wrought upon the loom
Of sensual lust and will-to-be,
It grew in stature like a tree,
But mind-informed, with fresh desires
Raging within like hungry fires,
Fed by the senses' ample fuel
In an eternal self-renewal.
Self-renewed and self-consumed,
A turbulence forever doomed
To futile striving, hopes and fears,
Alternating through the years:
Childhood, youth, maturity,
Seeking in vain security,
Seeking in vain to quench the fire
By satisfaction of desire.
And day by day with every breath,
Every heart-beat a little death,
Stole from the body's falling source
A fraction of its vital force.
The body undermined by stealth,
Then knew the pangs of failing health.

<h2><a id="passage-93">&sect;93</a> Verses of the Arahat Kulla Thera on seeing a corpse</h2>
<div class="excerpt verse">
<pre>
Having gone to the charnel-ground
I saw cast there a woman's corpse,
discarded in the cemetery,
being gnawn and full of worms.
A rotten congeries, Kulla, see &mdash;
diseased it is, impure,
oozing and trickling here and there
wherein fools find delight.
This body I inspected &mdash;
inane within and without &mdash;
taking the Dhamma's looking-glass
to Knowing and Seeing attained.
As this body is, so that body was;
as that body is, so will this body be.
As foul it is above so foul it is below,
and as it is above so it is below.
As it is by day, so it is by night;
as night, so day the same.
There's no such pleasure even from
a quintet's music as there is
from rightly Dhamma seeing
with singleness mind.
</pre>
<p class="cite">&mdash; Verses of the Elders Bhikkhus, 393-398</p>



<p>The "Knowing and Seeing" &mdash; insight (<i>vipassana</i>) &mdash; that this thera saw in himself is first:</p>

<p>Seeing no difference between the living and the dead bodies &mdash; only time makes a difference.</p>

<p>Then seeing the dead body as totally foul &mdash; not attracted to this (=greed) or repelled by that (=hatred), and applying this to his own body.</p>

<p>Then seeing that all the time, day or night, the body has the same qualities &mdash; not that it is desirable at some times but not at others.</p>

<p>The enjoyments that most get from senses-pleasures &mdash; here the example of a quintet is given &mdash; this thera has found far more abundantly in seeing Dhamma rightly.</p>

<h2><a id="passage-94">&sect;94</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p class="spkr">Spiritual objector:</p>
<p>"All this pondering over corpses and looking into the body's parts is just morbid. One should look at the body as a pure temple of the spirit."</p>

<p class="spkr">Practical Upasaka:<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20' id='fnt-20'>[20]</a></p>
<p>"It goes against the grain to gaze at the bits and pieces in this body and see that they have nothing attractive about them. But this way lies Liberation. To glorify the body is to be bound by craving for it."</p>
</div>
<h2><a id="passage-95">&sect;95</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p class="spkr">Doctor:</p>
<p>I cannot understand you when you say that the body is unbeautiful; to me it is such a wonderful machine!</p>

<p class="spkr">Bhikkhu:</p>
<p>The trouble with that view of the "wonderfulness of the body" is that it is near delight (<i>nandi</i>) and delighting in the body is another name for craving, the root of dukkha. Seeing the body's unattractiveness is opposed to craving.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="passage-96">&sect;96</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"You're wrong, man, sex is just natural, like breathing &mdash; just something you've got to do. Just like eating. It's a beautiful natural function!"</p>

<p>"Not true! Your comparisons are not apt."</p>

<p>"How come? You mean it's not natural?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sex is natural for people with desire, that means sex-desire or lust, in their hearts. But lust is a hindrance to the development of mental-emotional purity. But your comparisons to breathing and eating don't stand examination. Breathing is an automatic body function. No kamma, good or bad, is made because no intention is needed to decide to breathe!</p>

<p>"Eating is different because, though necessary for the body's life, it is connected with intention, so kamma is made. When greed for food is present, bad kamma is made which will fruit as suffering. But when food is eaten mindfully and just to keep the body going, then good kamma is made &mdash; of mindful reflection.</p>

<p>"Sex is different from both these. No sex takes place without desire or lust: this is among the unwholesome mental factors &mdash; it can never be karmically wholesome &mdash; so unwholesome kamma is made which has the nature to limit the mind to sensual things."</p>



<p>"That's painting sex too black!"</p>

<p>"No, that's being realistic. Of course, states of mind will vary while one has sex &mdash; more or less lust and more or less of loving-kindness. More lust (as when sex is commercial) means more bad kamma. More loving-kindness, as between two people deeply attached to each other, less bad kamma and more good kamma. In the latter case it is called kamma which is dark and bright, with a dark and bright result."</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="passage-97">&sect;97</a> A Manichee and a Buddhist</h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>M. It's all the work of Satan &mdash; this foul body. We agree with you Buddhists about that.</p>

<p>B. Well, the body is certainly not pleasant when examined, but we do not say that it has been created, by Satan.</p>

<p>M. But all matter is evil, foul, dragging the soul into darkness, as our Mani says.</p>

<p>B. That's not what the Buddha says, though. Matter is just earth, water, fire, and air elements which are quite neutral, neither good nor evil. They form bodies due to kamma made by beings; good or evil kammas both lead to the formation of bodies.</p>

<p>M. You must admit, though, that your body is a hindrance to the attainment of spiritual states. You have to feed it and rest it, dose it with medicine when it gets sick. Because of its wretchedness the soul is weighed down.</p>

<p>B. No, I do not admit that. The body is the basis and vehicle for practice so one should take care of it without pampering it. Though it has to eat, sleep, excrete, and it gets sick too, at these times we should be mindful, which is possible at all times when not asleep. Even the difficulties of the body can be used in Dhamma-practice. And what is this about a soul being weighed down?</p>

<p>M. Well, that is the pure aspirations, the pure thoughts, the still states of contemplation &mdash; that is the beginning of discovering the soul.</p>

<p>B. Oh, then the impure aspirations, thoughts and confused states of mind must be not soul! You should investigate all mental states, pure and impure, calm and distracted, and find out whether any of them are substantial or permanent. What would you find, do you think?</p>

<p>M. All right, they're changing. But behind them all is the pure tranquil soul, eternally unchanging.</p>

<p>B. But have you experienced this or are you just telling me some dogma or belief?</p>

<p>M. Yes, I think I have experienced it. Then one is free from the trammels of this body.</p>

<p>B. Really you need to examine all mental states, as I mentioned before, and the body too, in the same light. They're all Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta...</p>

<p>M. What...?</p>

<p>B. Sorry! I get so used to using those words that they have slipped off my tongue, unmindfully I am afraid! They mean impermanent, unsatisfactory, and no self. When you look at them like this you neither love the soul nor hate the body. That is, put in a Buddhist way, you don't cling to pure tranquility and identify it as your soul or self, neither do you reject this body. Don't lay the blame on this poor old body! It's not to blame.</p>

<p>M. But Mani says that it is.</p>

<p>B. Well then, I shall ask you a question. What makes decisions and choices, is it the body or the mind?</p>

<p>M. The mind decides, of course.</p>

<p>B. Then how can the body be blamed? It is not evil, nor is matter darkness. Poor old body just gets dragged along by the decisions the mind makes.</p>

<p>M. But you Buddhists practice contemplation of the body as foul. I have read about it.</p>

<p>B. Yes, but that does not mean it is evil. That kind of meditation is just to break up the attachment to the beauty of bodies. It is the attachment in one's own mind, not any Satan or evil creator, that is responsible for keeping the mind tied down to sensual pleasures. Look inside for the evil creator &mdash; his name is attachment, greed, desire, lust &mdash; and he is put out of business by contemplating the unattractive. The good creator is in there too, the mind that creates pure mental states, the experience of jhana and so on. But all this creating keeps one in the round of rebirth, you know!</p>

<h2><a id="passage-98">&sect;98</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>A. Hey, man! Why you cut your hair and beard? Hair's natural to have but you monks cut it off. We should keep it; it's natural, it's beautiful.</p>

<p>Bhikkhu: It's cut off for two reasons. First, it decorates this body. You people like decoration. That's what lay life is all about. But bhikkhus like the body plain, without distractions, so that they can see what it's really like.</p>

<p>A. Well, what's it really like?</p>

<p>B. If you like it as it is, "naturally," you should try not washing, not brushing the teeth or cleaning the nails, not combing the hair &mdash; and so on. Body and its parts are only beautiful if washing is also "natural."</p>

<p>A. So, you said that hair decorates, what's your other reason?</p>

<p>B. It's a disguise, that beard and moustache &mdash; it's something to hide behind, a mask. When you have no hair on the head and face you have no mask behind which to retire. Is it natural or beautiful to hide things? Isn't it better to open up? Who solves problems by hiding them away? Shaving hair and beard is also an outer token of the shaving off of conceit and pride which has to be done steadily and carefully over years of practice.</p>

<h2><a id="passage-100">&sect;100</a> The Silent Shrine</h2>
<div class="excerpt verse">

Where silence reigns the Buddha sits,
He dwells alone, the only face
Has He that one should ever look upon
Deep within the shrine that always is,
The center of this house &mdash;
Where is it found?
Flesh the walls and bones the beams
With windows five to look upon the world,
While wandering, a witless idiot
Roams through the empty rooms;
How slow is he to come upon that shrine,
How faltering his steps unsure!
Distractedly, confused
He fumbles for the door &mdash;
Hinges rusty, locked for long, unused,
Swollen wood and jammed the door decayed.
When will he look, this witless one,
When will he see the ancient face of peace?
When will he worship at the shrine?
When will he know the Way and Fruit?
When will he find the silence?
Where the Buddha sits?
