<h1><a id='intro'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>Of all the concepts central to Buddhism, merit <i>(pu&ntilde;&ntilde;a)</i> is one of the least known and least appreciated in the West. This is perhaps because the pursuit of merit seems to be a lowly practice, focused on getting and "selfing," whereas higher Buddhist practice focuses on letting go, particularly of any sense of self. Because we in the West often feel pressed for time, we don't want to waste our time on lowly practices, and instead want to go straight to the higher levels. Yet the Buddha repeatedly warns that the higher levels cannot be practiced in a stable manner unless they develop on a strong foundation. The pursuit of merit provides that foundation. To paraphrase a modern Buddhist psychologist, one cannot wisely let go of one's sense of self until one has developed a wise sense of self. The pursuit of merit is the Buddhist way to develop a wise sense of self.</p>
<p>The following readings show how this is done. They begin with a section on basic wisdom, which shows how the questions that lead ultimately to the wisdom of letting go first focus on things to hold onto: the skillful traits that, on the beginning level, provide a secure place to stand while letting go of character traits that are obviously harmful. Buddhist wisdom famously focuses in the characteristics of inconstancy, stress, and not-self, but the application of that wisdom grows out of the pursuit of what is relatively constant and pleasant, and requires a mature sense of self: able to plan for the future, to sacrifice short-term happiness for long-term happiness, to consider the needs of others, and to develop a strong sense of self-reliance in the pursuit of a happiness that is wise, pure, and compassionate.</p>
<p>The section on merit then sets out in general terms the types of meritorious activities that conduce to that happiness, focusing primarily on three: giving, virtue, and meditation. The next three sections focus on the ways in which each of these activities can be pursued so as to produce the most happiness. For instance, the section on giving discusses how the happiness of generosity can be maximized by wisely choosing the proper motivation for giving a gift, a proper gift, and a proper recipient for one's gift. The section on virtue shows how to learn from one's past mistakes without succumbing to debilitating feelings of guilt. The section on meditation discusses not only how the development of good will &mdash; the meditative practice most often cited in conjunction with merit &mdash; can lead to happiness both now and in the future, but also how it can help minimize the bad results of one's past unwise actions.</p>
<p>All three of these forms of merit conduce to the highest form of merit: the realization of stream-entry, the first glimpse of the deathless. Thus the penultimate section of this study guide focuses on the happiness and well-being that derive from this attainment.</p>
<p>For all the rewards of meritorious action, however, the concluding section serves as a reminder that the pursuit of happiness ultimately leads beyond the pursuit of merit. In fact, this study guide is planned as part of a two-part study guide covering the Buddhist approach to the pursuit of happiness, with the second part discussing the teachings on the three characteristics as the next stage in this approach as they lead to the deathless happiness attained with arahantship. Still, it would be a mistake to view the two stages as radically separate. In the course of developing a wise sense of self in the pursuit of merit, one is already learning how to let go of unwise ways of "selfing" as one learns to overcome stinginess, apathy, and hard-heartedness through the development of giving, virtue, and good will. The teachings on the three characteristics simply carry this same process of "de-selfing" for the sake of an even truer happiness to a higher pitch.</p>

<p>"There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, &amp; becomes bewildered.

<p>"What do you think, Rahula: What is a mirror for?"</p>
<p>"For reflection, sir."</p>
<p>"In the same way, Rahula, bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection.</p>
<p>"Whenever you want to perform a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I want to perform &mdash; would it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences, happy results, then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do.</p>
<p>"While you are performing a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I am doing &mdash; is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to affliction of others, or both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.</p>
<p>"Having performed a bodily act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should confess it, reveal it, lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life. Having confessed it... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed &amp; joyful, training day &amp; night in skillful mental qualities.</p>
<p><i>(Similarly with verbal and mental acts, except for the last paragraph under mental acts:)</i></p>
<p>"Having performed a mental act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should feel distressed, ashamed, &amp; disgusted with it. Feeling distressed... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed &amp; joyful, training day &amp; night in skillful mental qualities.</p>
<p>"Rahula, all those brahmans &amp; contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"All those brahmans &amp; contemplatives in the course of the future who will purify their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"All those brahmans &amp; contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"Thus, Rahula, you should train yourself: 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection.' That's how you should train yourself."</p>

<p>"And what is the self as a governing principle? There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this: 'It's not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness; it's not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of [future] becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness. Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, &amp; death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, [and I hope,] "Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress might be known!" Now, if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness &mdash; or a worse sort &mdash; that would not be fitting for me.' So he reflects on this: 'My persistence will be aroused &amp; not lax; my mindfulness established &amp; not confused; my body calm &amp; not aroused; my mind centered &amp; unified.' Having made himself his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in a pure way. This is called the self as a governing principle."</p>

<p>So, aiming at Suppabuddha the leper, the Blessed One gave a step-by-step talk, i.e., <i>a talk on generosity, on virtue, on heaven; he declared the drawbacks, degradation, &amp; corruption of sensual passions, and the rewards of renunciation.</i> Then when he saw that Suppabuddha the leper's mind was ready, malleable, free from hindrances, elated, &amp; bright, he then gave the Dhamma-talk peculiar to Awakened Ones, i.e., stress, origination, cessation, &amp; path.

I am cognizant that, having long performed meritorious deeds, I long experienced desirable, pleasing, endearing, charming results. Having developed a mind of good will for seven years, then for seven aeons of contraction &amp; expansion I didn't return to this world. Whenever the aeon was contracting, I went to the realm of Streaming Radiance. Whenever the aeon was expanding, I reappeared in an empty Brahma-abode. There I was the Great Brahman, the Unconquered Conqueror, All-seeing, &amp; Wielder of Power. Then for thirty-six times I was Sakka, ruler of the gods. For many hundreds of times I was a king, a wheel-turning emperor, a righteous king of Dhamma, conqueror of the four corners of the earth, maintaining stable control over the countryside, endowed with the seven treasures<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-7treasures' id='fnt-7treasures'>[*]</a> &mdash; to say nothing of the times I was a local king. The thought occurred to me: 'Of what action of mine is this the fruit, of what action the result, that I now have such great power &amp; might?' Then the thought occurred to me: 'This is the fruit of my three [types of] action, the result of three types of action, that I now have such great power &amp; might: i.e., generosity, self-control, &amp; restraint.'"</p>

Even though they may say, "We are dear to ourselves," still they aren't dear to themselves. Why is that? Of their own accord, they act toward themselves as an enemy would act toward an enemy; thus they aren't dear to themselves. But those who engage in good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, &amp; good mental conduct are dear to themselves. Even though they may say, "We aren't dear to ourselves," still they are dear to themselves. Why is that?

<p>"Then there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life... and has right views. And he gives food, drink, cloth, vehicles, garlands, scents, creams, bed, lodging, &amp; lamps to brahmans &amp; contemplatives. With the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of devas. There he experiences the five strings of divine sensuality [delightful sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations].

But at any rate, brahman, the donor does not go without reward."</p>
<p>"It's amazing, Master Gotama, it's astounding, how it's enough to make one want to give a gift, enough to make one want to make an offering, where the donor does not go without reward."</p>
<p>"That's the way it is, brahman. That's the way it is. The donor does not go without reward."</p>
<p>"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama &mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash; made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>

<p>Then Ven. Sariputta, together with the lay followers from Campa, went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Might there be the case where a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit, whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sariputta, there would..."</p>
<p>"Why, lord...?"</p>
<p>"Sariputta, there is the case where a person gives a gift seeking his own profit, with a mind attached [to the reward], seeking to store up for himself [with the thought], 'I'll enjoy this after death.' He gives his gift &mdash; food, drink, clothing, a vehicle; a garland, perfume, &amp; ointment; bedding, shelter, &amp; a lamp &mdash; to a brahman or a contemplative. What do you think, Sariputta? Might a person give such a gift as this?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"Having given this gift seeking his own profit &mdash; with a mind attached [to the reward], seeking to store up for himself, [with the thought], 'I'll enjoy this after death' &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of the Four Great Kings. Then, having exhausted that action, that power, that status, that sovereignty, he is a returner, coming back to this world.</p>
<p>"Then there is the case of a person who gives a gift not seeking his own profit, not with a mind attached [to the reward], not seeking to store up for himself, nor [with the thought], 'I'll enjoy this after death.' Instead, he gives a gift with the thought, 'Giving is good.' He gives his gift &mdash; food, drink, clothing, a vehicle; a garland, perfume, &amp; ointment; bedding, shelter, &amp; a lamp &mdash; to a brahman or a contemplative. What do you think, Sariputta? Might a person give such a gift as this?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"Having given this gift with the thought, 'Giving is good,' on the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of the devas of the Thirty-three. Then, having exhausted that action, that power, that status, that sovereignty, he is a returner, coming back to this world.</p>
<p>"Or, instead of thinking, 'Giving is good,' he gives a gift with the thought, 'This was given in the past, done in the past, by my father &amp; grandfather. It would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued'... on the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of the devas of the Hours. Then, having exhausted that action, that power, that status, that sovereignty, he is a returner, coming back to this world.</p>
<p>"Or, instead... he gives a gift with the thought, 'I am well-off. These are not well-off. It would not be right for me, being well-off, not to give a gift to those who are not well-off'... on the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of the Contented devas. Then, having exhausted that action, that power, that status, that sovereignty, he is a returner, coming back to this world.</p>
<p>"Or, instead... he gives a gift with the thought, 'Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past &mdash; Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, &amp; Bhagu &mdash; in the same way will this be my distribution of gifts'... on the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of the devas who delight in creation. Then, having exhausted that action, that power, that status, that sovereignty, he is a returner, coming back to this world.</p>
<p>"Or, instead... he gives a gift with the thought, 'When this gift of mine is given, it makes the mind serene. Gratification &amp; joy arise'... on the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of the devas who have power over the creations of others. Then, having exhausted that action, that power, that status, that sovereignty, he is a returner, coming back to this world.</p>
<p>"Or, instead of thinking, 'When this gift of mine is given, it makes the mind serene. Gratification &amp; joy arise,' he gives a gift with the thought, 'This is an ornament for the mind, a support for the mind.' He gives his gift &mdash; food, drink, clothing, a vehicle; a garland, perfume, &amp; ointment; bedding, shelter, &amp; a lamp &mdash; to a brahman or a contemplative. What do you think, Sariputta? Might a person give such a gift as this?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"Having given this, not seeking his own profit, not with a mind attached [to the reward], not seeking to store up for himself, nor [with the thought], 'I'll enjoy this after death,'</p>
<p>&mdash; nor with the thought, 'Giving is good,'</p>
<p>&mdash; nor with the thought, 'This was given in the past, done in the past, by my father &amp; grandfather. It would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued,'</p>
<p>&mdash; nor with the thought, 'I am well-off. These are not well-off.

<p>&mdash; nor with the thought, 'When this gift of mine is given, it makes the mind serene. Gratification &amp; joy arise,'</p>
<p>&mdash; but with the thought, 'This is an ornament for the mind, a support for the mind' &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of Brahma's Retinue. Then, having exhausted that action, that power, that status, that sovereignty, he is a non-returner. He does not come back to this world.</p>
<p>"This, Sariputta, is the cause, this is the reason, why a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit, whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit."</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>So Prince Payasi established a donation for brahmans, contemplatives, indigents, hoboes, paupers, &amp; beggars. And in that donation he gave food of this sort: unhusked rice porridge together with pickle brine. And he gave rough cloth with knotted fringe. Now a brahman youth named Uttara was the superintendent of that donation. As he was giving the donation he dedicated it in this way:"Through this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life, but not in the next." Prince Payasi heard that Uttara, when giving the donation, dedicated it in this way: "Through this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life, but not in the next." So, having summoned him, he said to him, "Is it true, dear boy, that when giving the donation you dedicated in this way: 'Through this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life, but not in the next'?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"But why do you dedicate it in this way...? Don't we who wish to gain merit hope for the fruit of our donation?"</p>
<p>"But, sir, the food in the donation is like this: unhusked rice porridge together with pickle brine. You wouldn't want to touch it with your foot, much less eat it. And the rough cloth with knotted fringe: You wouldn't want to touch it with your foot, much less wear it. You are dear &amp; charming to us, so how can we connect what is dear &amp; charming with what is not charming?"</p>
<p>"Then in that case, my dear boy, establish [a donation with] the sort of food that I eat and the sort of cloth that I wear."</p>
<p>Responding, "Yes, sir," Uttara the brahman youth established [a donation with] the sort of food that Prince Payasi ate and the sort of cloth that Prince Payasi wore. Then Prince Payasi &mdash; having given the donation inattentively, having given the donation not with his own hand, having given the donation thoughtlessly, having given the donation as if he were throwing it away &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death, reappeared in the company of the devas of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serisaka palace. But Uttara, the brahman youth who was the superintendent of the donation &mdash; having given the donation attentively, having given the donation with his own hand, having given the donation thoughtfully, having given the donation not as if he were throwing it away &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death, reappeared in the good destination, the heavenly world, in the company of the [higher] devas of the Thirty-three.</p>

<p>"And how is a donation endowed with six factors? There is the case where the donor has three factors and the recipients have three. And which are the donor's three factors. There is the case where the donor, before giving, is happy. While giving his/her mind is clear &amp; confident. After giving, he/she is gratified. There are the donor's three factors. And which are the recipients' three factors? There is the case where the recipients are free from passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion; they are free of aversion or are practicing for the subduing of aversion; they are free of delusion or are practicing for the subduing of delusion. These are the recipients' three factors... Now, it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as 'just this much bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss, heavenly, ripening in bliss leading to heaven, leading to what is agreeable, pleasing, charming, happy, &amp; beneficial.'

<p>Then King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him, "Well now, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"</p>
<p>"Just now, lord, a money-lending householder died in Savatthi. I have come from conveying his heirless fortune to the royal palace: ten million in silver, to say nothing of the gold. But even though he was a money-lending householder, his enjoyment of food was like this: he ate broken rice &amp; pickle brine. His enjoyment of clothing was like this: he wore three lengths of hempen cloth. His enjoyment of a vehicle was like this: he rode in a dilapidated little cart with an awning of leaves."</p>
<p>"That's the way it is, great king. That's the way it is. Once in the past that money-lending householder provided alms for the Private Buddha named Tagarasikhi. Saying [to his servant], 'Give alms to the contemplative,' he got up from his seat and left. After giving, though, he felt regret: 'It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms'... Now, the result of his action in having provided alms for the Private Buddha named Tagarasikhi was that he appeared seven times in a good destination, the heavenly world. And through the remaining result of that action he acted as money-lender seven times in this very same Savatthi. But the result of his action in feeling regret after giving [those] alms &mdash; 'It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms' &mdash; was that his mind didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of food, didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of clothing, didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of a vehicle, didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of the five strings of sensuality."</p>

<p>Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, I have heard that 'Gotama the contemplative says this: "Only to me should a gift be given, and not to others. Only to my disciples should a gift be given, and not to others. Only what is given to me bears great fruit, and not what is given to others. Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit, and not what is given to the disciples of others."' Now those who report this: Are they reporting the Master Gotama's actual words, are they not misrepresenting him with what is unfactual, are they answering in line with the Dhamma, so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing them? For we don't want to misrepresent the Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"Vaccha, whoever says this: 'Gotama the contemplative says this: "Only to me should a gift be given... Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit, and not what is given to the disciples of others," is not reporting my actual words, is misrepresenting me with what is unfactual &amp; untrue.</p>
<p>"Vaccha, whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates three obstructions, three impediments. Which three? He creates an obstruction to the merit of the giver, an obstruction to the recipient's gains, and prior to that he undermines and harms his own self. Whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates these three obstructions, these three impediments.</p>
<p>"I tell you, Vaccha, even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond, thinking, 'May whatever animals live here feed on this,' that would be a source of merit, to say nothing of what is given to human beings. But I do say that what is given to a virtuous person is of great fruit, and not so much what is given to an unvirtuous person."</p>

<p>"But a gift given where, lord, bears great fruit?"</p>
<p>"This [question] is one thing, great king &mdash; 'Where should a gift be given?' &mdash; while this &mdash; 'A gift given where bears great fruit?' &mdash; is something else entirely. What is given to a virtuous person &mdash; rather than to an unvirtuous one &mdash; bears great fruit. In that case, great king, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer as you see fit.</p>
<p>"What do you think, great king? There is the case where you have a war at hand, a battle imminent. A noble-warrior youth would come along &mdash; untrained, unpracticed, undisciplined, undrilled, fearful, terrified, cowardly, quick to flee. Would you take him on? Would you have any use for a man like that?"</p>
<p>"No, lord, I wouldn't take him on. I wouldn't have any use for a man like that."</p>
<p>"Then a brahman youth... a merchant youth... a laborer youth would come along &mdash; untrained, unpracticed, undisciplined, undrilled, fearful, terrified, cowardly, quick to flee. Would you take him on? Would you have any use for a man like that?"</p>
<p>"No, lord, I wouldn't take him on. I wouldn't have any use for a man like that."</p>
<p>"Now, what do you think, great king? There is the case where you have a war at hand, a battle imminent.

Would you have any use for a man like that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord, I would take him on. I would have use for a man like that."</p>
<p>"In the same way, great king. When someone has gone forth from the home life into homelessness &mdash; no matter from what clan &mdash; and he has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five, what is given to him bears great fruit.</p>
<p>"And which five factors has he abandoned? He has abandoned sensual desire... ill will... sloth &amp; drowsiness... restlessness &amp; anxiety... uncertainty. These are the five factors he has abandoned. And with which five factors is he endowed? He is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training... the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training... the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training... the aggregate of release of one beyond training... the aggregate of knowledge &amp; vision of release of one beyond training. These are the five factors with which he is endowed.</p>
<p>"What is given to one who has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five factors in this way bears great fruit."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Cleansing with regard to the body, Cunda, is threefold; cleansing with regard to speech is fourfold; and cleansing with regard to the mind, threefold. And how is cleansing with regard to the body threefold? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not take the ungiven property of another, whether in a village or in the wilderness, with thievish intent. Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct. He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man. This is how cleansing with regard to the body is threefold.</p>
<p>"And how is cleansing with regard to speech fourfold? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech. When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering of his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty [i.e., a court proceeding], if he is asked as a witness, 'Come and tell, good man, what you know': If he doesn't know, he says, 'I don't know.' If he does know, he says, 'I know.' If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward. Abandoning divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing &amp; pleasing to people at large. Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, and the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. This is how cleansing with regard to speech is fourfold.</p>
<p>"And how is cleansing with regard to the mind threefold? There is the case where a certain person is not covetous. He does not covet the property of another, thinking, 'O, if only what belongs to another were mine!' He is not malevolent at heart or destructive in his resolves. He thinks, 'May these beings &mdash; free from animosity, free from oppression, and free from trouble &mdash; look after themselves with ease.' He has right views and an unperverted outlook. He believes, 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits and results of good and bad actions. There is this world and the next world. There is mother and father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are brahmans and contemplatives who, living rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves.' This is how cleansing with regard to the mind is threefold."</p>

	Intelligent,
you should guard your virtue,
aspiring to three forms of bliss:
	praise;
	the obtaining of wealth;
	and, after death, rejoicing
in heaven.
Even if you do no evil
but seek out one who does,
you're suspected of evil.
Your bad reputation
	grows.
	The sort of person you make a friend,
	the sort you seek out,
that's the sort you yourself become &mdash;
for your living together is of
	that sort.
The one associated with,
the one who associates,
the one who's touched,
the one who touches another
	&mdash; like an arrow smeared with poison &mdash;
contaminates the quiver.
So, fearing contamination, the enlightened
should not be comrades
with evil people.
A man who wraps rotting fish
in a blade of kusa grass
makes the grass smelly:
	so it is
	if you seek out fools.
But a man who wraps powdered incense
in the leaf of a tree
makes the leaf fragrant:
	so it is
	if you seek out
	the enlightened.
	So,
knowing your own outcome
as like the leaf-wrapper's,
you shouldn't seek out
those who aren't good.
The wise would associate
with those who are.
Those who aren't good
lead you to hell.
The good help you reach

<p>Then Asibandhakaputta the headman, a disciple of the Niganthas, went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him: "Headman, how does Nigantha Nataputta teach the Dhamma to his disciples?"</p>
<p>"Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way, lord: 'All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell. All those who steal... All those who indulge in illicit sex... All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell. Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led [to a state of rebirth].' That's how Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples."</p>
<p>"If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led [to a state of rebirth],' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words. What do you think, headman: If a man is one who takes life, then taking into consideration time spent doing &amp; not doing, whether by day or by night, which time is more: the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life?"</p>
<p>"... the time he spends taking life is less, lord, and the time he spends not taking life is certainly more. If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led [to a state of rebirth],' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words."</p>
<p>"What do you think, headman: If a man is one who steals... indulges in illicit sex... tells lies, then taking into consideration time spent doing &amp; not doing, whether by day or by night, which time is more: the time he spends telling lies or the time he spends not telling lies?"</p>
<p>"... the time he spends telling lies is less, lord, and the time he spends not telling lies is certainly more. If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led [to a state of rebirth],' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words."</p>
<p>"There's the case, headman, where a certain teacher holds this doctrine, holds this view: 'All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell. All those who steal... All those who indulge in illicit sex... All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell.' A disciple has faith in that teacher, and the thought occurs to him, 'Our teacher holds this doctrine, holds this view: "All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell." There are living beings that I have killed. I, too, am destined for the plane of deprivation, am destined for hell.' He fastens onto that view. If he doesn't abandon that doctrine, doesn't abandon that state of mind, doesn't relinquish that view, then as if he were to be carried off, he would thus be placed in hell.</p>
<p>"[The thought occurs to him,] 'Our teacher holds this doctrine, holds this view: 'All those who steal... All those who indulge in illicit sex...

He fastens onto that view. If he doesn't abandon that doctrine, doesn't abandon that state of mind, doesn't relinquish that view, then as if he were to be carried off, he would thus be placed in hell.</p>
<p>"There is the case, headman, where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear knowing &amp; conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of those to be tamed, teacher of human &amp; divine beings, awakened, blessed. He, in various ways, criticizes &amp; censures the taking of life, and says, 'Abstain from taking life.' He criticizes &amp; censures stealing, and says, 'Abstain from stealing.' He criticizes &amp; censures indulging in illicit sex, and says, 'Abstain from indulging in illicit sex.' He criticizes &amp; censures the telling of lies, and says, 'Abstain from the telling of lies.'</p>
<p>"A disciple has faith in that teacher and reflects: 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes &amp; censures the taking of life, and says, "Abstain from taking life." There are living beings that I have killed, to a greater or lesser extent. That was not right. That was not good. But if I become remorseful for that reason, that evil deed of mine will not be undone.' So, reflecting thus, he abandons right then the taking of life, and in the future refrains from taking life. This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed. This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika Mango Grove. Then Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "The brahmans of the Western lands, lord &mdash; those who carry water pots, wear garlands of water plants, purify with water, &amp; worship fire &mdash; can take [the spirit of] a dead person, lift it out, instruct it, &amp; send it to heaven. But the Blessed One, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so that all the world, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think: There is the case where a man is one who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, &amp; idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to wrong views. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' What do you think: would that man &mdash; because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Rise up, O boulder! Come floating up, O boulder! Come float to the shore, O boulder!' What do you think: would that boulder &mdash; because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &mdash; rise up, come floating up, or come float to the shore?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"So it is with any man who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, &amp; idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to wrong views. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart &mdash; [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' &mdash; still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell.</p>
<p>"Now what do you think: There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from indulging in illicit sex; he refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, &amp; from idle chatter; he is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to right view. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' What do you think: would that man &mdash; because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break. There the shards &amp; jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would come up. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Sink, O ghee/oil! Submerge, O ghee/oil! Go down, O ghee/oil!' What do you think: would that ghee/oil, because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink, submerge, or go down?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"So it is with any man who refrains from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from indulging in illicit sex; refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, &amp; from idle chatter; is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to right view. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart &mdash; [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' &mdash; still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "All the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising (in heaven) do not equal one-sixteenth of awareness-release through good will.

<p>"Just as the radiance of all the stars does not equal one-sixteenth of the radiance of the moon, as the moon &mdash; surpassing them &mdash; shines, blazes, &amp; dazzles, even so, all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal one-sixteenth of awareness-release through good will.

<p>"Just as in the last month of the rains, in autumn, when the sky is clear &amp; cloudless, the sun, on ascending the sky, overpowers the space immersed in darkness, shines, blazes, &amp; dazzles, even so, all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal one-sixteenth of awareness-release through good will.

When one develops &mdash; mindful &mdash;
good will without limit,
fetters are worn through,
on seeing the ending
of acquisitions.

If with uncorrupted mind
you feel good will
	for even
	one
	being,
you become skilled from that.
But a Noble One produces
	a mind of sympathy
	for
	   all
	       beings,
	an abundance of merit.

Kingly seers, who conquered the earth
	swarming with beings,
went about making sacrifices:
	the horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,
	water rites, soma rites,
	&amp; the "Unobstructed,"
but these don't equal
one sixteenth
of a well-developed mind of good will &mdash;
as all the constellations don't,
one sixteenth
of the radiance of the moon.

One who neither kills
	nor gets others to kill,
	neither conquers,
	nor gets others to conquer,
with good will for all beings,
has no hostility with anyone
	at all.

<p>Then the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed One. On arrival, some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side. Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and, after an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, sat to one side. Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm-to-palm over their hearts. Some of them sat to one side having announced their name &amp; clan. Some of them sat to one side in silence.</p>
<p>As they sat there, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One, "Lord, there are some brahmans &amp; contemplatives who come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. And then other brahmans &amp; contemplatives come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. They leave us absolutely uncertain &amp; in doubt: Which of these venerable brahmans &amp; contemplatives are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?"</p>
<p>"Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are in doubt. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when undertaken &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering' &mdash; then you should abandon them.</p>
<p>"What do you think, Kalamas? When greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"</p>
<p>"For harm, lord."</p>
<p>"And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed by greed, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering."</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p><i>(Similarly with aversion and delusion.)</i></p>
<p>"So, as I said, Kalamas: 'Don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, "This contemplative is our teacher." When you know for yourselves that, "These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when undertaken &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering" &mdash; then you should abandon them.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"Now, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when undertaken &amp; carried out, lead to welfare &amp; to happiness' &mdash; then you should enter &amp; remain in them.</p>
<p>"What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"</p>
<p>"For welfare, lord."</p>
<p>"And this ungreedy person, not overcome by greed, his mind not possessed by greed, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness."</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>

Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"Now, Kalamas, one who is a disciple of the noble ones &mdash; thus devoid of greed, devoid of ill will, undeluded, alert, &amp; resolute &mdash; keeps pervading the first direction [the east] &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with good will. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.</p>
<p>"He keeps pervading the first direction &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with compassion. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with compassion: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.</p>
<p>"He keeps pervading the first direction &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with appreciation. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with appreciation: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.</p>
<p>"He keeps pervading the first direction &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with equanimity. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with equanimity: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.</p>
<p>"Now, Kalamas, one who is a disciple of the noble ones &mdash; his mind thus free from hostility, free from ill will, undefiled, &amp; pure &mdash; acquires four assurances in the here-&amp;-now:</p>
<p>"'If there is a world after death, if there is the fruit of actions rightly &amp; wrongly done, then this is the basis by which, with the break-up of the body, after death, I will reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world.' This is the first assurance he acquires.</p>
<p>"'But if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit of actions rightly &amp; wrongly done, then here in the present life I look after myself with ease &mdash; free from hostility, free from ill will, free from trouble.' This is the second assurance he acquires.</p>
<p>"'If evil is done through acting, still I have willed no evil for anyone. Having done no evil action, from where will suffering touch me?' This is the third assurance he acquires.</p>
<p>"'But if no evil is done through acting, then I can assume myself pure in both respects.' This is the fourth assurance he acquires.</p>
<p>"One who is a disciple of the noble ones &mdash; his mind thus free from hostility, free from ill will, undefiled, &amp; pure &mdash; acquires these four assurances in the here-&amp;-now."</p>

<p>"Monks, there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you: timely or untimely, true or false, affectionate or harsh, beneficial or unbeneficial, with a mind of good-will or with inner hate.

<p>"Suppose there were a catskin bag &mdash; beaten, well-beaten, beaten through &amp; through, soft, silky, free of rustling &amp; crackling &mdash; and a man were to come along carrying a stick or shard and saying, 'With this stick or shard I will take this catskin bag &mdash; beaten, well-beaten, beaten through &amp; through, soft, silky, free of rustling &amp; crackling &mdash; and I will make it rustle &amp; crackle.' Now, what do you think &mdash; would he, with that stick or shard, take that catskin bag &mdash; beaten, well-beaten, beaten through &amp; through, soft, silky, free of rustling &amp; crackling &mdash; and make it rustle &amp; crackle?"</p>
<p>"No, lord. Why is that? Because the catskin bag is beaten, well-beaten, beaten through &amp; through, soft, silky, free of rustling &amp; crackling. It's not easy to make it rustle &amp; crackle with a stick or shard. The man would reap only a share of weariness &amp; disappointment."</p>
<p>"In the same way, monks, there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you... In any event, you should train yourselves: 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare, with a mind of good will, and with no inner hate. We will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and, beginning with him, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will equal to a catskin bag &mdash; abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.' That's how you should train yourselves.</p>
<p>"Monks, even if bandits were to carve you up savagely, limb by limb, with a two-handled saw, he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding. Even then you should train yourselves: 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic, with a mind of good will, and with no inner hate. We will keep pervading these people with an awareness imbued with good will and, beginning with them, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will &mdash; abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.' That's how you should train yourselves.</p>
<p>"Monks, if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw, do you see any aspects of speech, slight or gross, that you could not endure?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Then attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw. That will be for your long-term welfare &amp; happiness."</p>

This is to be done by one skilled in aims
who wants to break through to the state of peace:
Be capable, upright, &amp; straightforward,
easy to instruct, gentle, &amp; not conceited,
content &amp; easy to support,
with few duties, living lightly,
with peaceful faculties, masterful,
modest, &amp; no greed for supporters.

Do not do the slightest thing
that the wise would later censure.

Think: Happy, at rest,
may all beings be happy at heart.
Whatever beings there may be,
	weak or strong, without exception,
	long, large,
	middling, short,
	subtle, blatant,
	seen &amp; unseen,
	near &amp; far,
	born &amp; seeking birth:
May all beings be happy at heart.

Let no one deceive another
or despise anyone anywhere,
or through anger or irritation
wish for another to suffer.

As a mother would risk her life
to protect her child, her only child,
even so should one cultivate a limitless heart
with regard to all beings.
With good will for the entire cosmos,
cultivate a limitless heart:
Above, below, &amp; all around,
unobstructed, without hostility or hate.
Whether standing, walking,
sitting, or lying down,
	as long as one is alert,
one should be resolved on this mindfulness.
This is called a sublime abiding
	here &amp; now.

Not taken with views,
but virtuous &amp; consummate in vision,
having subdued desire for sensual pleasures,
	one never again
	will lie in the womb.

The Vehapphala devas, monks, have a life-span of 500 eons.  A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, is unbound right in that state of being. This, monks, is the difference, this the distinction, this the distinguishing factor, between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated run-of-the-mill person, when there is a destination, a reappearing."</p>

	<dd>The Abhassara, Subhakinha, and Vehapphala devas are all Brahmas on the level of form.</dd>

	<dd>This sutta, read in conjunction with AN 4.123, has given rise to the belief that the development of good will as an immeasurable state can lead only to the first jhana, and that the next two immeasurable states &mdash; compassion and appreciation &mdash; can lead, respectively, only to the second and third jhanas. However, as <a href="../../tipitaka/an/an08/an08.063.than.html">AN 8.63</a> shows below, all four immeasurable states can lead all the way to the fourth jhana. The difference between that discourse and this lies in how the person practicing these states relates to them. In that sutta, the person deliberately uses the state as a basis for developing all the jhanas. In this sutta, the person simply enjoys the state and remains in it.</dd>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone in seclusion: heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute."</p>
<p>"But it is in just this way that some worthless men make a request but then, having been told the Dhamma, think they should tag along right behind me."</p>
<p>"May the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief! May the One Well-gone teach me the Dhamma in brief! It may well be that I will understand the Blessed One's words. It may well be that I will become an heir to the Blessed One's words."</p>
<p>"Then, monk, you should train yourself thus: 'My mind will be established inwardly, well-composed. No evil, unskillful qualities, once they have arisen, will remain consuming the mind.' That's how you should train yourself.</p>
<p>"Then you should train yourself thus: 'Good-will, as my awareness-release, will be developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken.' That's how you should train yourself. When you have developed this concentration in this way, you should develop this concentration with directed thought &amp; evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; a modicum of evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; no evaluation, you should develop it accompanied by rapture... not accompanied by rapture... endowed with a sense of enjoyment; you should develop it endowed with equanimity.</p>
<p>"When this concentration is thus developed, thus well-developed by you, you should then train yourself thus: 'Compassion, as my awareness-release... Appreciation, as my awareness-release... Equanimity, as my awareness-release, will be developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken.' That's how you should train yourself. When you have developed this concentration in this way, you should develop this concentration with directed thought &amp; evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; a modicum of evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; no evaluation, you should develop it accompanied by rapture... not accompanied by rapture... endowed with a sense of enjoyment; you should develop it endowed with equanimity.</p>
<p>"When this concentration is thus developed, thus well-developed by you, you should then train yourself thus: 'I will remain focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.' That's how you should train yourself. When you have developed this concentration in this way, you should develop this concentration with directed thought &amp; evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; a modicum of evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; no evaluation, you should develop it accompanied by rapture... not accompanied by rapture... endowed with a sense of enjoyment; you should develop it endowed with equanimity.</p>
<p>"When this concentration is thus developed, thus well-developed by you, you should train yourself: 'I will remain focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves... the mind in &amp; of itself... mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.' That's how you should train yourself. When you have developed this concentration in this way, you should develop this concentration with directed thought &amp; evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; a modicum of evaluation, you should develop it with no directed thought &amp; no evaluation, you should develop it accompanied by rapture... not accompanied by rapture... endowed with a sense of enjoyment; you should develop it endowed with equanimity.</p>
<p>"When this concentration is thus developed, thus well-developed by you, then wherever you go, you will go in comfort. Wherever you stand, you will stand in comfort. Wherever you sit, you will sit in comfort. Wherever you lie down, you will lie down in comfort."</p>
<p>Then that monk, having been admonished by the admonishment from the Blessed One, got up from his seat and bowed down to the Blessed One, circled around him, keeping the Blessed One to his right side, and left. Then, dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And thus he became another one of the Arahants.</p>

<p>"There is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction [the east] &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with good will. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will. He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form, feeling, perception, fabrications, &amp; consciousness, as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, an emptiness, not-self. At the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in conjunction with the devas of the Pure Abodes. This rebirth is not in common with run-of-the-mill people."</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Then again, a monk keeps pervading the first direction [the east] with an awareness imbued with good will, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will &mdash; abundant, expansive, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will. He reflects on this and discerns, 'This awareness-release through good will is fabricated &amp; intended. Now whatever is fabricated &amp; intended is inconstant &amp; subject to cessation.' Staying right there, he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations. Or, if not, then &mdash; through this very Dhamma-passion, this Dhamma-delight, and from the total wasting away of the first five Fetters &mdash; he is due to be reborn [in the Pure Abodes], there to be totally unbound, never again to return from that world.</p>
<p>"This too, householder, is a single quality declared by the Blessed One &mdash; the one who knows, the one who sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened &mdash; where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute becomes released, or his unended fermentations go to their total ending, or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Monks, there are these four bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness, nourishments of bliss. Which four?</p>
<p>"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' This is the first bonanza of merit, bonanza, of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss. "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.' This is the second bonanza of merit, bonanza, of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully &mdash; in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types &mdash; they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.' This is the third bonanza of merit, bonanza, of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration. This is the fourth bonanza of merit, bonanza, of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>
<p>"These are four bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness, nourishments of bliss."</p>

<p><i>SN 55.32 defines the fourth bonanza of merit as follows:</i> "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones lives at home with an awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous, responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms.</p>
<p><i>SN 55.33 defines it as follows:</i> "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising &amp; passing away &mdash; noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress."</p>
<p>"Just as it is not easy to take the measure of the water in the great ocean as 'just this many pails of water or hundreds of pails of water or thousands of pails of water or hundreds of thousands of pails of water.' It is reckoned simply as a great mass of water that is unreckonable, immeasurable. In the same way, when a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with these four bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness, it is not easy to take the measure of the merit as 'just this much bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss, heavenly, ripening in bliss leading to heaven, leading to what is agreeable, pleasing, charming, happy, &amp; beneficial.'

<p>"Then there is the case of the person who has no doubt or perplexity, who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'I have no doubt or perplexity. I have arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma.' He doesn't grieve, isn't tormented; doesn't weep, beat his breast, or grow delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death."</p>

<p>[The Buddha is speaking to Nandaka, the chief minister of the Licchavis, concerning the first list of bonanzas of merit:]"A disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is linked with long life, human or divine; is linked with beauty, human or divine; is linked with happiness, human or divine; is linked with status, human or divine; is linked with influence, human or divine.</p>
<p>"I tell you this, Nandaka, not having heard it from any other brahman or contemplative. Instead, I tell you this having known, seen, and realized it for myself."</p>
<p>When this was said, a certain man said to Nandaka, the chief minister of the Licchavis, "It is now time for your bath, sir."</p>
<p>[Nandaka responded,] "Enough, I say, with this external bath. I am satisfied with this internal bath: confidence in the Blessed One."</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One, picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail, said to the monks, "What do you think, monks? Which is greater: the little bit of dust I have picked up with the tip of my fingernail, or the great earth?"</p>
<p>"The great earth is far greater, lord. The little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing. It's not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth &mdash; this little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail &mdash; when compared with the great earth."</p>
<p>"In the same way, monks, for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view, an individual who has broken through [to stream-entry], the suffering &amp; stress totally ended &amp; extinguished is far greater. That which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing: it's not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth, when compared with the previous mass of suffering. That's how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma, monks. That's how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eye."</p>
