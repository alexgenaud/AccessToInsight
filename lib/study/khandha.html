<h1><a id='intro'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>

<p>The Buddha's Awakening gave him, among other things, a new perspective on the uses and limitations of words. He had discovered a reality &mdash; the Deathless &mdash; that no words could describe. At the same time, he discovered that the path to Awakening could be described, although it involved a new way of seeing and conceptualizing the problem of suffering and stress. Because ordinary concepts were often poor tools for teaching the path, he had to invent new concepts and to stretch pre-existing words to encompass those concepts so that others could taste Awakening themselves.</p>

<p>One of the new concepts most central to his teaching was that of the khandhas, usually translated into English as "aggregates." Prior to the Buddha, the Pali word khandha had very ordinary meanings: A khandha could be a pile, a bundle, a heap, a mass. It could also be the trunk of a tree. In his first sermon, though, the Buddha gave it a new, psychological meaning, introducing the term "clinging-khandhas" to summarize his analysis of the truth of stress and suffering. Throughout the remainder of his teaching career, he referred to these psychological khandhas time and again. Their importance in his teachings has thus been obvious to every generation of Buddhists ever since. Less obvious, though, has been the issue of how they are important: How should a meditator make use of the concept of the psychological khandhas? What questions are they meant to answer?</p>

<p>The most common response to these questions is best exemplified by two recent scholarly books devoted to the subject. Both treat the khandhas as the Buddha's answer to the question, "What is a person?" To quote from the jacket of the first:</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p>"If Buddhism denies a permanent self, how does it perceive identity?&hellip; What we conventionally call a 'person' can be understood in terms of five aggregates, the sum of which must not be taken for a permanent entity, since beings are nothing but an amalgam of ever-changing phenomena&hellip; [W]ithout a thorough understanding of the five aggregates, we cannot grasp the liberation process at work within the individual, who is, after all, simply an amalgam of the five aggregates."</p>
</div>

<p>From the introduction of the other:</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p>"The third key teaching is given by the Buddha in contexts when he is asked about individual identity: when people want to know 'what am I?', 'what is my real self?'. The Buddha says that individuality should be understood in terms of a combination of phenomena which appear to form the physical and mental continuum of an individual life. In such contexts, the human being is analysed into five constituents &mdash; the <i>pa&ntilde;cakkhandh&#257;</i> [five aggregates]."</p>
</div>

<p>This understanding of the khandhas isn't confined to scholars. Almost any modern Buddhist meditation teacher would explain the khandhas in a similar way. And it isn't a modern innovation. It was first proposed at the beginning of the common era in the commentaries to the early Buddhist canons &mdash; both the Therav&#257;din and the Sarv&#257;stiv&#257;din, which formed the basis for Mah&#257;y&#257;na scholasticism.</p>

<p>However, once the commentaries used the khandhas to define what a person is, they spawned many of the controversies that have plagued Buddhist thinking ever since: "If a person is just khandhas, then what gets reborn?" "If a person is just khandhas, and the khandhas are annihilated on reaching total nibb&#257;na, then isn't total nibb&#257;na the annihilation of the person?" "If a person is khandhas, and khandhas are interrelated with other khandhas, how can one person enter nibb&#257;na without dragging everyone else along?"</p>

<p>A large part of the history of Buddhist thought has been the story of ingenious but unsuccessful attempts to settle these questions. It's instructive to note, though, that the Pali canon never quotes the Buddha as trying to answer them. In fact, it never quotes him as trying to define what a person is at all. Instead, it quotes him as saying that to define yourself in any way is to limit yourself, and that the question, "What am I?" is best ignored. This suggests that he formulated the concept of the khandhas to answer other, different questions. If, as meditators, we want to make the best use of this concept, we should look at what those original questions were, and determine how they apply to our practice.</p>

<p>The canon depicts the Buddha as saying that he taught only two topics: suffering and the end of suffering (<a href='#passage-2'>&sect;2</a>). A survey of the Pali discourses shows him using the concept of the khandhas to answer the primary questions related to those topics: What is suffering? How is it caused? What can be done to bring those causes to an end?</p>

<p>The Buddha introduced the concept of the khandhas in his first sermon in response to the first of these questions. His short definition of suffering was "the five clinging-khandhas." This fairly cryptic phrase can be fleshed out by drawing on other passages in the canon.</p>

<p>The five khandhas are bundles or piles of form, feeling, perception, fabrications, and consciousness. None of the texts explain why the Buddha used the word khandha to describe these things. The meaning of "tree trunk" may be relevant to the pervasive fire imagery in the canon &mdash; nibb&#257;na being extinguishing of the fires of passion, aversion, and delusion &mdash; but none of the texts explicitly make this connection. The common and explicit image is of the khandhas as burdensome (<a href='#passage-22'>&sect;22</a>). We can think of them as piles of bricks we carry on our shoulders. However, these piles are best understood, not as objects, but as activities, for an important passage (<a href='#passage-7'>&sect;7</a>) defines them in terms of their functions. Form &mdash; which covers physical phenomena of all sorts, both within and without the body &mdash; wears down or "de-forms." Feeling feels pleasure, pain, and neither pleasure nor pain. Perception labels or identifies objects. Consciousness cognizes the six senses (counting the intellect as the sixth) along with their objects. Of the five khandhas, fabrication is the most complex. Passages in the canon define it as intention, but it includes a wide variety of activities, such as attention, evaluation (<a href='#passage-14'>&sect;14</a>), and all the active processes of the mind. It is also the most fundamental khandha, for its intentional activity underlies the experience of form, feeling, etc., in the present moment.</p>

<p>Thus intention is an integral part of our experience of all the khandhas &mdash; an important point, for this means that there is an element of intention in all suffering. This opens the possibility that suffering can be ended by changing our intentions &mdash; or abandoning them entirely &mdash; which is precisely the point of the Buddha's teachings.</p>

<p>To understand how this happens, we have to look more closely at how suffering arises &mdash; or, in other words, how khandhas become clinging-khandhas.</p>

<p>When khandhas are experienced, the process of fabrication normally doesn't simply stop there. If attention focuses on the khandhas' attractive features &mdash; beautiful forms, pleasant feelings, etc. &mdash; it can give rise to passion and delight (<a href='#passage-36'>&sect;36</a>). This passion and delight can take many forms, but the most tenacious is the habitual act of fabricating a sense of me or mine, identifying with a particular khandha (or set of khandhas) or claiming possession of it.</p>

<p>This sense of me and mine is rarely static. It roams like an amoeba, changing its contours as it changes location. Sometimes expansive, sometimes contracted, it can view itself as identical with a khandha, as possessing a khandha, as existing within a khandha, or as having a khandha existing within itself (<a href='#passage-24'>&sect;24</a>). At times feeling finite, at other times infinite (<a href='#passage-25'>&sect;25</a>), whatever shape it takes it's always unstable and insecure, for the khandhas providing its food are simply activities and functions, inconstant and insubstantial. In the words of the canon, the khandhas are like foam, like a mirage, like the bubbles formed when rain falls on water (<a href='#passage-44'>&sect;44</a>). They're heavy only because the iron grip of trying to cling to them is burdensome. As long as we're addicted to passion and delight for these activities &mdash; as long as we cling to them &mdash; we're bound to suffer.</p>

<p>The Buddhist approach to ending this clinging, however, is not simply to drop it. As with any addiction, the mind has to be gradually weaned away. Before we can reach the point of no intention, where we're totally freed from the fabrication of khandhas, we have to change our intentions toward the khandhas so as to change their functions. Instead of using them for the purpose of constructing a self, we use them for the purpose of creating a path to the end of suffering. Instead of carrying piles of bricks on our shoulders, we take them off and lay them along the ground as pavement.</p>

<p>The first step in this process is to use the khandhas to construct the factors of the noble eightfold path. For example, Right Concentration: Each of the four jh&#257;nas and the first three formless attainments, are called perception-attainments, for they are based on maintaining a steady perception of the object of meditation (<a href='#passage-31'>&sect;31</a>). In the first jh&#257;na, for instance, we maintain a steady perception focused on an aspect of form, such as the breath, and used directed thought and evaluation &mdash; which count as fabrications &mdash; to create feelings of pleasure and refreshment, which we spread through the body (<a href='#passage-29'>&sect;29</a>). In the beginning, it's normal that we experience passion and delight for these feelings, and that consciousness follows along in line with them. This helps get us absorbed in mastering the skills of concentration.</p>

<p>Once we've gained the sense of strength and wellbeing that comes from mastering these skills, we can proceed to the second step: attending to the drawbacks of even the refined khandhas we experience in concentration, so as to undercut the passion and delight we might feel for them:</p>

<p>"Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay, so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances, to fire accurate shots in rapid succession, and to pierce great masses. In the same way, there is the case where a monk&hellip; enters &amp; remains in the first jh&#257;na: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form, feeling, perceptions, fabrications, &amp; consciousness, as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, a void, not-self. [Similarly with the other levels of jh&#257;na]" (<a href='#passage-31'>&sect;31</a>).</p>

<p>The various ways of fostering dispassion are also khandhas, khandhas of perception. A standard list includes the following: the perception of inconstancy, the perception of not-self, the perception of unattractiveness, the perception of drawbacks (the diseases to which the body is subject), the perception of abandoning, the perception of distaste for every world, the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications (<a href='#passage-32'>&sect;32</a>). One of the most important of these perceptions is that of not-self. When the Buddha first introduced the concept of not-self in his second sermon (SN 22:59 &mdash; see <a href='#passage-52'>&sect;52</a>), he also introduced a way of strengthening its impact with a series of questions based around the khandhas. Taking each khandha in turn, he asked: "Is it constant or inconstant?" Inconstant. "And is what is inconstant stressful or pleasurable?" Stressful. "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" No.</p>

<p>These questions show the complex role the khandhas play in this second step of the path. The questions themselves are khandhas &mdash; of fabrication &mdash; and they use the concept of the khandhas to deconstruct any passion and delight that might center on the khandhas and create suffering. Thus, in this step, we use khandhas that point out the drawbacks of the khandhas.</p>

<p>If used unskillfully, though, these perceptions and fabrications can simply replace passion with its mirror image, aversion. This is why they have to be based on the first step &mdash; the wellbeing constructed in jh&#257;na &mdash; and coupled with the third step, the perceptions of dispassion and cessation that incline the mind to the deathless: "This is peace, this is exquisite &mdash; the resolution of all fabrications; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding" (<a href='#passage-31'>&sect;31</a>). In effect, these are perception-khandhas that point the mind beyond all khandhas.</p>

<p>The texts say that this three-step process can lead to one of two results. If, after undercutting passion and delight for the khandhas, the mind contains any residual passion for the perception of the deathless, it will attain the third level of Awakening, called non-return. If passion and delight are entirely eradicated, though, all clinging is entirely abandoned, the intentions that fabricate khandhas are dropped, and the mind totally released. The bricks of the pavement have turned into a runway, and the mind has taken off.</p>

<p>Into what? The authors of the discourses seem unwilling to say, even to the extent of describing it as a state of existence, non-existence, neither, or both (<a href='#passage-49'>&sect;&sect;49-51</a>). As one of the discourses states, the freedom lying beyond the khandhas also lies beyond the realm to which language properly applies (<a href='#passage-49'>&sect;49</a>; see also AN 4:173). There is also the very real practical problem that any preconceived notions of that freedom, if clung to as a perception-khandha, could easily act as an obstacle to its attainment. Still, there is also the possibility that, if properly used, such a perception-khandha might act as an aid on the path. So the discourses provide hints in the form of similes, referring to total freedom as:</p>

<div class='excerpt freeverse'>
The unfashioned, the unbent,
the fermentation-free, the true, the beyond,
the subtle, the very-hard-to-see,
the ageless, permanence, the undecaying,
the featureless, non-elaboration,
peace, the deathless,
the exquisite, bliss, rest,
the ending of craving,
the wonderful, the marvelous,
the secure, security,
unbinding,
the unafflicted, dispassion, purity,
release, attachment-free,
the island, shelter, harbor, refuge,
    the ultimate.&nbsp;
<p class='cite'>&mdash; SN 43.1-44</p>
</div>

<p>Other passages mention a consciousness in this freedom &mdash; "without feature or surface, without end, luminous all around" &mdash; lying outside of time and space, experienced when the six sense spheres stop functioning (<a href='#passage-54'>&sect;54</a>). In this it differs from the consciousness-khandha, which depends on the six sense spheres and can be described in such terms as near or far, past, present, or future. Consciousness without feature is thus the awareness of Awakening. And the freedom of this awareness carries over even when the awakened person returns to ordinary consciousness. As the Buddha said of himself:</p>

<p>"Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from form, the Tath&#257;gata dwells with unrestricted awareness. Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from feeling&hellip; perception&hellip; fabrications&hellip; consciousness&hellip; birth&hellip; aging&hellip; death&hellip; suffering &amp; stress&hellip; defilement, the Tath&#257;gata dwells with unrestricted awareness" (<a href='#passage-56'>&sect;56</a>).</p>

<p>This shows again the importance of bringing the right questions to the teachings on the khandhas. If you use them to define what you are as a person, you tie yourself down to no purpose. The questions keep piling on. But if you use them to put an end to suffering, your questions fall away and you're free. You never again cling to the khandhas and no longer need to use them to end your self-created suffering. As long as you're still alive, you can employ the khandhas as needed for whatever skillful uses you see fit. After that, you're liberated from all uses and needs, including the need to find words to describe that freedom to yourself or to anyone else.</p>

<p>"It's just as when a dog is tied by a leash to a post or stake: If it walks, it walks right around that post or stake. If it stands, it stands right next to that post or stake. If it sits, it sits right next to that post or stake. If it lies down, it lies down right next to that post or stake.</p>

<p>"In the same way, an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person regards form as: 'This is mine, this is my self, this is what I am.' He regards feeling&hellip; perception&hellip; fabrications&hellip; consciousness as: 'This is mine, this is my self, this is what I am.' If he walks, he walks right around these five clinging-aggregates. If he stands, he stands right next to these five clinging-aggregates. If he sits, he sits right next to these five clinging-aggregates. If he lies down, he lies down right next to these five clinging-aggregates. Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment: 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion, aversion, &amp; delusion.' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled. From the purification of the mind are beings purified.</p>

<p>"Monks, have you ever seen a moving-picture show?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord."</p>

<p>"That moving-picture show was created by the mind. And this mind is even more variegated than a moving-picture show. Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment: 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion, aversion, &amp; delusion.' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled. From the purification of the mind are beings purified.</p>

<p>"Monks, I can imagine no one group of beings more variegated than that of common animals. Common animals are created by mind. And the mind is even more variegated than common animals. Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment: 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion, aversion, &amp; delusion.' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled.

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-32">&sect; 32.</a></b> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near S&#257;vatth&#299;, in Jeta's Grove, An&#257;thapi&#7751;&#7693;ika's monastery. And on that occasion Ven. Girim&#257;nanda was diseased, in pain, severely ill. Then Ven. &#256;nanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, Ven. Girim&#257;nanda is diseased, in pain, severely ill. It would be good if the Blessed One would visit Ven. Girim&#257;nanda, out of sympathy for him."</p>

<p>"&#256;nanda, if you go to the monk Girim&#257;nanda and tell him ten perceptions, it's possible that when he hears the ten perceptions his disease may be allayed. Which ten? The perception of inconstancy, the perception of not-self, the perception of unattractiveness, the perception of drawbacks, the perception of abandoning, the perception of dispassion, the perception of cessation, the perception of distaste for every world, the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications, mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>[1] "And what is the perception of inconstancy? There is the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; reflects thus: 'Form is inconstant, feeling is inconstant, perception is inconstant, fabrications are inconstant, consciousness is inconstant.' Thus he remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the five aggregates. This, &#256;nanda, is called the perception of inconstancy.</p>

<p>[2] "And what is the perception of not-self? There is the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; reflects thus: 'The eye is not-self, forms are not-self; the ear is not-self, sounds are not-self; the nose is not-self, aromas are not-self; the tongue is not-self, flavors are not-self; the body is not-self, flavors are not-self; the intellect is not-self, ideas are not-self.' Thus he remains focused on not-selfness with regard to the six inner &amp; outer sense media. This is called the perception of not-self.</p>

<p>[3] "And what is the perception of unattractiveness? There is the case where a monk ponders this very body &mdash; from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on down, surrounded by skin, filled with all sorts of unclean things: 'There is in this body: hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, muscle, tendons, bones, bone marrow, spleen, heart, liver, membranes, kidneys, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, gorge, feces, gall, phlegm, lymph, blood, sweat, fat, tears, oil, saliva, mucus, oil in the joints, urine.' Thus he remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to this very body. This is called the perception of unattractiveness.</p>

<p>[4] "And what is the perception of drawbacks? There is the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling &mdash; reflects thus: 'This body has many pains, many drawbacks. In this body many kinds of disease arise, such as: seeing-diseases, hearing-diseases, nose-diseases, tongue-diseases, body-diseases, head-diseases, ear-diseases, mouth-diseases, teeth-diseases, cough, asthma, catarrh, fever, aging, stomach-ache, fainting, dysentery, grippe, cholera, leprosy, boils, ringworm, tuberculosis, epilepsy, skin-diseases, itch, scab, psoriasis, scabies, jaundice, diabetes, hemorrhoids, fistulas, ulcers; diseases arising from bile, from phlegm, from the wind-property, from combinations of bodily humors, from changes in the weather, from uneven care of the body, from attacks, from the result of kamma; cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, urination.' Thus he remains focused on drawbacks with regard to this body. This is called the perception of drawbacks.</p>

<p>[5] "And what is the perception of abandoning? There is the case where a monk does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, &amp; wipes it out of existence. He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill-will. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, &amp; wipes it out of existence. He does not tolerate an arisen thought of harmfulness. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, &amp; wipes it out of existence. He does not tolerate arisen evil, unskillful mental qualities. He abandons them, destroys them, dispels them, &amp; wipes them out of existence. This is called the perception of abandoning.</p>

<p>[6] "And what is the perception of dispassion? There is the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; reflects thus: 'This is peace, this is exquisite &mdash; the stilling of all fabrications, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the ending of craving, dispassion, Unbinding.' This is called the perception of dispassion.</p>

<p>[7] "And what is the perception of cessation? There is the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; reflects thus: 'This is peace, this is exquisite &mdash; the stilling of all fabrications, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the ending of craving, cessation, Unbinding.' This is called the perception of cessation.</p>

<p>[8] "And what is the perception of distaste for every world? There is the case where a monk abandoning any attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions with regard to any world, refrains from them and does not get involved. This is called the perception of distaste for every world.</p>

<p>[9] "And what is the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications? There is the case where a monk feels horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted with all fabrications. This is called the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications.</p>

<p>[10] "And what is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing? There is the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>

<p>"[i] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' [ii] Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' [iii] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' [iv] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'</p>

<p>"[v] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture.' [vi] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure.' [vii] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication.' [viii] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication.'</p>

<p>"[ix] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind.' [x] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind.' [xi] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in steadying the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out steadying the mind. [xii] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in releasing the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out releasing the mind.'</p>

<p>"[xiii] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy.' [xiv] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion [literally, fading].' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion.' [xv] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation.' [xvi] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.'"</p>

<p>"This, &#256;nanda, is called mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"Now, &#256;nanda, if you go to the monk Girim&#257;nanda and tell him these ten perceptions, it's possible that when he hears these ten perceptions his disease may be allayed."</p>

<p>Then Ven. &#256;nanda, having learned these ten perceptions in the Blessed One's presence, went to Ven. Girim&#257;nanda and told them to him. As Ven. Girim&#257;nanda heard these ten perceptions, his disease was allayed. And Ven. Girim&#257;nanda recovered from his disease. That was how Ven. Girim&#257;nanda's disease was abandoned.</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-35">&sect; 35.</a></b> [Ven. S&#257;riputta:] "Suppose there were a householder or householder's son &mdash; rich, wealthy, with many possessions &mdash; who was thoroughly well-guarded. Then suppose there came along a certain man, desiring what was not his benefit, desiring what was not his welfare, desiring his loss of security, desiring to kill him. The thought would occur to this man: 'It would not be easy to kill this person by force. What if I were to sneak in and then kill him?'</p>

<p>"So he would go to the householder or householder's son and say, 'May you take me on as a servant, lord.' With that, the householder or householder's son would take the man on as a servant.</p>

<p>"Having been taken on as a servant, the man would rise in the morning before his master, go to bed in the evening only after his master, doing whatever his master ordered, always acting to please him, speaking politely to him. Then the householder or householder's son would come to regard him as a friend &amp; companion, and would fall into his trust. When the man realizes, 'This householder or householder's son trusts me,' then encountering him in a solitary place, he would kill him with a sharp knife.</p>

<p>"Now what do you think, my friend Yamaka? When that man went to the householder or householder's son and said, 'May you take me on as a servant, lord': wasn't he even then a murderer? And yet although he was a murderer, the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer.' And when, taken on as a servant, he would rise in the morning before his master, go to bed in the evening only after his master, doing whatever his master ordered, always acting to please him, speaking politely to him: wasn't he even then a murderer? And yet although he was a murderer, the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer.' And when he encountered him in a solitary place and killed him with a sharp knife: wasn't he even then a murderer?

<p>"Friends, it's not that I say 'I am form,' nor do I say 'I am something other than form.' It's not that I say, 'I am feeling&hellip; perception&hellip; fabrications&hellip; consciousness,' nor do I say, 'I am something other than consciousness.' With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, 'I am' has not been overcome, although I don't assume that 'I am this.'</p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<p>"Then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly?"</p>

<p>"As the scent of the flower: That's how he would describe it if he were describing it correctly."</p>

<p>"Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, he still has with regard to the five clinging-aggregates a lingering residual 'I am' conceit, an 'I am' desire, an 'I am' obsession. But at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising &amp; passing away with regard to the five clinging-aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance. Such is feeling&hellip; Such is perception&hellip; Such are fabrications&hellip; Such is consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.' As he keeps focusing on the arising &amp; passing away of these five clinging-aggregates, the lingering residual 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated.</p>

<p>"Just like a cloth, dirty &amp; stained: Its owners give it over to a washerman, who scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cow-dung and then rinses it in clear water. Now even though the cloth is clean &amp; spotless, it still has a lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cow-dung. The washerman gives it to the owners, the owners put it away in a scent-infused wicker hamper, and its lingering residual scent of salt earth, lye, or cow-dung is fully obliterated.</p>

As he keeps focusing on the arising &amp; passing away of these five clinging-aggregates, the lingering residual 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated."</p>

<p>When this was said, the elder monks said to Ven. Khemaka, "We didn't cross-examine Ven. Khemaka with the purpose of troubling him, just that (we thought) Ven. Khemaka is capable of declaring the Blessed One's message, teaching it, describing it, setting it forth, revealing it, explaining it, making it plain &mdash; just as he has in fact declared it, taught it, described it, set it forth, revealed it, explained it, made it plain."</p>

<p>That is what Ven. Khemaka said. Gratified, the elder monks delighted in his words. And while this explanation was being given, the minds of sixty-some monks, through no clinging, were fully released from fermentations &mdash; as was Ven. Khemaka's.</p>

<p>"Thus he assumes, assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant, entangled in pleasure and pain, subject to arising and passing away, he who says, 'Feeling is my self.' Thus in this manner, &#256;nanda, one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the self.</p>

<p>"As for the person who says, 'Feeling is not the self: My self is oblivious (to feeling),' he should be addressed as follows: 'My friend, where nothing whatsoever is sensed [experienced] at all, would there be the thought, "I am"?'"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Thus in this manner, &#256;nanda, one does not see fit to assume that 'Feeling is not my self: My self is oblivious (to feeling).'</p>

<p>"As for the person who says, 'Neither is feeling my self, nor is my self oblivious (to feeling), but rather my self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling,' he should be addressed as follows: 'My friend, should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder, then with feeling completely not existing, owing to the cessation of feeling, would there be the thought, "I am"?'"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Thus in this manner, &#256;nanda, one does not see fit to assume that 'Neither is feeling my self, nor is my self oblivious (to feeling), but rather my self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling.'</p>

<p>"Now, &#256;nanda, in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self, nor the self as oblivious, nor that 'My self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling,' then, not assuming in this way, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Unagitated, he is totally unbound right within. He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

<p>"If anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that 'The Tath&#257;gata exists after death,' is his view, that would be mistaken; that 'The Tath&#257;gata does not exist after death'&hellip; that 'The Tath&#257;gata both exists and does not exist after death'&hellip; that 'The Tath&#257;gata neither exists nor does not exist after death' is his view, that would be mistaken. Why? Having directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation, the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression, the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description, the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment, the extent to which the cycle revolves: Having directly known that, the monk is released. The view that, 'Having directly known that, the monk released does not see, does not know,' would be mistaken."</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-50">&sect; 50.</a></b> Then Ven. Anur&#257;dha went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Just now I was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hut. Then a large number of wandering sectarians came and&hellip; said to me, 'Friend Anur&#257;dha, the Tath&#257;gata &mdash; the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment &mdash; being described, is described with (one of) these four positions: The Tath&#257;gata exists after death, does not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

<p>"When this was said, I said to them, 'Friends, the Tath&#257;gata &mdash; the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment &mdash; being described, is described otherwise than with these four positions: The Tath&#257;gata exists after death, does not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

<p>"When this was said, the wandering sectarians said to me, 'This monk is either a newcomer, not long gone forth, or else an elder who is foolish &amp; inexperienced.' So, addressing me as they would a newcomer or a fool, they got up from their seats and left. Then not long after they had left, this thought occurred to me: 'If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians, how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said, will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual, will answer in line with the Dhamma, and no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me?'"</p>

<p>"What do you think, Anur&#257;dha: Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord."</p>

<p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

<p>"Stressful, lord."</p>

<p>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"&hellip; Is feeling constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord"&hellip;</p>

<p>"&hellip; Is perception constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord"&hellip;</p>

<p>"&hellip; Are fabrications constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord"&hellip;</p>

<p>"What do you think, Anur&#257;dha: Is consciousness constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord."</p>

<p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

<p>"Stressful, lord."</p>

<p>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Anur&#257;dha: Do you regard form as the Tath&#257;gata?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Do you regard feeling as the Tath&#257;gata?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Do you regard perception as the Tath&#257;gata?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Do you regard fabrications as the Tath&#257;gata?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Do you regard consciousness as the Tath&#257;gata?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Anur&#257;dha: Do you regard the Tath&#257;gata as being in form?&hellip; Elsewhere than form?&hellip; In feeling?&hellip; Elsewhere than feeling?&hellip; In perception?&hellip; Elsewhere than perception?&hellip; In fabrications?&hellip; Elsewhere than fabrications?&hellip; In consciousness?&hellip; Elsewhere than consciousness?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"What do you think: Do you regard the Tath&#257;gata as form-feeling-perception-fabrications-consciousness?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Do you regard the Tath&#257;gata as that which is without form, without feeling, without perception, without fabrications, without consciousness?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"And so, Anur&#257;dha &mdash; when you can't pin down the Tath&#257;gata as a truth or reality even in the present life &mdash; is it proper for you to declare, 'Friends, the Tath&#257;gata &mdash; the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment &mdash; being described, is described otherwise than with these four positions: The Tath&#257;gata exists after death, does not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Very good, Anur&#257;dha. Very good. Both formerly &amp; now, it's only stress that I describe, and the cessation of stress."</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-51">&sect; 51.</a></b> [After a similar set of questions and answers between Ven. S&#257;riputta and Ven. Yamaka, S&#257;riputta says:]</p>

<p>"And so, my friend Yamaka &mdash; when you can't pin down the Tath&#257;gata as a truth or reality even in the present life &mdash; is it proper for you to declare, 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One, a monk with no more fermentations, on the break-up of the body, is annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death'?</p>

<p>"Previously, my friend S&#257;riputta, I did foolishly hold that evil supposition. But now, having heard your explanation of the Dhamma, I have abandoned that evil supposition, and have broken through to the Dhamma.</p>

<p>"Then, friend Yamaka, how would you answer if you are thus asked: A monk, a worthy one, with no more fermentations: what is he on the break-up of the body, after death?</p>

<p>"Thus asked, I would answer, 'Form is inconstant&hellip; Feeling&hellip; Perception&hellip; Fabrications&hellip; Consciousness is inconstant. That which is inconstant is stressful. That which is stressful has ceased and gone to its end."  &mdash;  SN <i>22:85</i></p>
</div>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-52">&sect; 52.</a></b> Now at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk: "So &mdash; form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, fabrications are not-self, consciousness is not-self. Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is not-self?"</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One, realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monk's awareness, addressed the monks: "It's possible that a senseless person &mdash; immersed in ignorance, overcome with craving &mdash; might think that he could outsmart the Teacher's message in this way: 'So &mdash; form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, fabrications are not-self, consciousness is not-self. Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is not-self?' Now, monks, haven't I trained you in counter-questioning with regard to this &amp; that topic here &amp; there? What do you think: Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord."</p>

<p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

<p>"Stressful, lord."</p>

<p>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"&hellip; Is feeling constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord"&hellip;</p>

<p>"&hellip; Is perception constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord"&hellip;</p>

<p>"&hellip; Are fabrications constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord"&hellip;</p>

<p>"What do you think, monks: Is consciousness constant or inconstant?"</p>

<p>"Inconstant, lord."</p>

<p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

<p>"Stressful, lord."</p>

<p>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.'</p>

<p>"Any feeling whatsoever&hellip;</p>

<p>"Any perception whatsoever&hellip;</p>

<p>"Any fabrications whatsoever&hellip;</p>

<p>"Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.'</p>

<p>"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words. And while this explanation was being given, the minds of sixty monks, through no clinging, were fully released from fermentations.</p>
