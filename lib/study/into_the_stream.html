<h1><a id='part1'>I: The Way to Stream Entry</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<h2><a id='intro1'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>The Pali Canon recognizes four levels of Awakening, the first of which is called stream entry. This gains its name from the fact that a person who has attained this level has entered the "stream" flowing inevitably to nibbana. He/she is guaranteed to achieve full awakening within seven lifetimes at most, and in the interim will not be reborn in any of the lower realms.</p>
<p>This study guide on stream entry is divided into two parts. The first deals with the practices leading to stream entry; the second, with the experience of stream entry and its results.</p>

<p>The practices leading to stream entry are encapsulated in four factors:</p>

<div class='excerpt freeverse'>
Association with people of integrity is a factor for stream-entry.
Listening to the true Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry.
Appropriate attention is a factor for stream-entry.
Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry.
<p class='cite'>&mdash; SN 55.5</p></div>

<p>These factors form the framework for the first part of this study guide.</p>

<p>The Canon's treatment of these factors touches on questions of interest to all meditators, regardless of whether their practice aims all the way to Awakening: How can you recognize a trustworthy teacher? How can you tell the true Dhamma from counterfeit Dhamma? What are the rewards that come from listening to the Dhamma? Which questions should you ask yourself in the course of the practice? What kind of practice qualifies as being in accordance with the Dhamma? What kind of qualities do you need to develop to benefit most from your practice?</p>

<p>For your practice to lead to Awakening, you must develop reliable standards for answering these questions. The Buddha offers some preliminary guidance on developing these standards in his instructions to the brahman teenager, Kapadika Bharadvaja.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>[Kapadika Bharadvaja:] "To what extent is there an awakening to the truth? To what extent does one awaken to the truth? We ask Master Gotama about awakening to the truth."</p>

<p>[The Buddha:] "There is the case, Bharadvaja, where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or town. Then a householder or householder's son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities &mdash; qualities based on greed, qualities based on aversion, qualities based on delusion: 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed that, with his mind overcome by these qualities, he might say, "I know," while not knowing, or say, "I see," while not seeing; or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his/her long-term harm &amp; pain?' As he observes him, he comes to know, 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed... His bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior are those of one not greedy. And the Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's greedy.</p>

<p>"When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on greed, he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion... based on delusion: 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that, with his mind overcome by these qualities, he might say, "I know," while not knowing, or say, "I see," while not seeing; or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his/her long-term harm &amp; pain?' As he observes him, he comes to know, 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on delusion... His bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior are those of one not deluded. And the Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's deluded.</p>

<p>"When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on delusion, he places conviction in him. With the arising of conviction, he visits him &amp; grows close to him. Growing close to him, he lends ear. Lending ear, he hears the Dhamma. Hearing the Dhamma, he remembers it. Remembering it, he penetrates the meaning of those dhammas. Penetrating the meaning, he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammas. There being an agreement through pondering those dhammas, desire arises. With the arising of desire, he becomes willing. Willing, he contemplates [lit: "weighs," "compares"]. Contemplating, he makes an exertion. Exerting himself, he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with discernment.</p>

<p>"To this extent, Bharadvaja, there is an awakening to the truth. To this extent one awakens to the truth. I describe this as an awakening to the truth. But it is not yet the final attainment of the truth."</p>

<p>[Kapadika Bharadvaja:] "Yes, Master Gotama, to this extent there is an awakening to the truth. To this extent one awakens to the truth. We regard this as an awakening to the truth. But to what extent is there the final attainment of the truth? To what extent does one finally attain the truth? We ask Master Gotama about the final attainment of the truth."</p>

<p>[Buddha:] "The cultivation, development, &amp; pursuit of those very same qualities: to this extent, Bharadvaja, there is the final attainment of the truth. To this extent one finally attains the truth. I describe this as the final attainment of the truth."</p>

<h2><a id='association'>Association with People of Integrity</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p>"With regard to external factors, I don't envision any other single factor like friendship with admirable people as doing so much for a monk in training, who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage. A monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
A monk who is a friend
to admirable people
&mdash; who's reverential, respectful,
doing what his friends advise &mdash;
mindful, alert,
attains step by step
	the ending of all fetters.

<div class="excerpt">
<p>As he was seated to one side, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy life, lord: having admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Having admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues, he can be expected to develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path.</p>

<p>"And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues, develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path? There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops right resolve... right speech... right action... right livelihood... right effort... right mindfulness... right concentration dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues, develops &amp; pursues the noble eightfold path.</p>

<p>"And through this line of reasoning one may know how having admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life: It's in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair have gained release from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair."</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"And what does it mean to have admirable people as friends? There is the case where a lay person, in whatever town or village he may dwell, spends time with householders or householders' sons, young or old, who are advanced in virtue. He talks with them, engages them in discussions. He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction, consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue, consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity, and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment. This is called having admirable people as friends...</p>

<p>"And what does it mean to be consummate in conviction? There is the case where a noble disciple has conviction, is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of devas &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' This is called being consummate in conviction.</p>

<p>"And what does it mean to be consummate in virtue? There is the case where a noble disciple abstains from taking life, abstains from stealing, abstains from illicit sexual conduct, abstains from lying, abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessness. This is called being consummate in virtue.</p>

<p>"And what does it mean to be consummate in generosity? There is the case of a noble disciple, his awareness cleansed of the stain of miserliness, living at home, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous, responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms. This is called being consummate in generosity.</p>

<p>"And what does it mean to be consummate in discernment? There is the case where a noble disciple is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising and passing away &mdash; noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress. This is called being consummate in discernment."</p>

<p>Admirable friends are to be recognized both by what they say and by what they do.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>As they were sitting to one side, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One, "Venerable sir, there are some contemplatives &amp; brahmans who come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. And then other contemplatives &amp; brahmans come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. They leave us simply uncertain &amp; doubtful: Which of these venerable contemplatives &amp; brahmans are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?"</p>

<p>"Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are doubtful. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when undertaken &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering' &mdash; then you should abandon them...</p>

<p>"What do you think, Kalamas: When greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"</p>

<p>"For harm, lord."</p>

<p>"And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed by greed: Doesn't he kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, and induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord."</p>

<p>[Similarly for aversion &amp; delusion.]</p>

<p>"So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?"</p>

<p>"Unskillful, lord."</p>

<p>"Blameworthy or blameless?"</p>

<p>"Blameworthy, lord."</p>

<p>"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?"</p>

<h2><a id='attention'>Appropriate Attention</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>


<p>Having heard the Dhamma, it is important to bring appropriate attention &mdash; seeing things in terms of cause and effect &mdash; both to what you have heard and to your experiences in general, for this one factor can make all the difference in the success or failure of your practice.</p>


<div class="excerpt">
<p>"With regard to internal factors, I don't envision any other single factor like appropriate attention as doing so much for a monk in training, who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage. A monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful.</p>

<div class="freeverse">
Appropriate attention

<p>I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicket. Now at that time, he spent the day's abiding thinking evil, unskillful thoughts: i.e., thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, thoughts of harmfulness.</p>

<p>Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:</p>

<div class="freeverse">
"From inappropriate attention
you're being chewed by your thoughts.
Relinquishing what's inappropriate,

	appropriately.

Keeping your mind on the Teacher,
the Dhamma, the Sangha, your virtues,

	joy,
	rapture,
	pleasure
	without doubt.

Then, 		saturated
	with joy,
you will put an end
to suffering &amp; stress."

<p>Appropriate attention is essentially the ability to frame your understanding of experience in the right terms. In many cases, this means framing the right questions for gaining insight into suffering and its end.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"This is the way leading to discernment: when visiting a contemplative or brahman, to ask: 'What is skillful, venerable sir? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What, having been done by me, will be for my long-term harm &amp; suffering? Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &amp; happiness?'"</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person...does not discern what ideas are fit for attention, or what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention, and attends [instead] to ideas unfit for attention. And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming... the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases... This is how he attends inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?'</p>

<p>"As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view <i>I have a self</i> arises in him as true &amp; established, or the view<i> I have no self</i>... or the view<i> It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self</i>... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self</i>... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self</i> arises in him as true &amp; established, or else he has a view like this: <i>This very self of mine &mdash; the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to the</i><i>ripening of good &amp; bad actions &mdash; is the self of mine that is constant,</i><i> everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity.</i> This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, &amp; death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from stress.</p>

<p>"The well-instructed noble disciple... discerns what ideas are fit for attention, and what ideas are unfit for attention.

Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality does not arise, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of becoming... the unarisen effluent of ignorance does not arise, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned... He attends appropriately, <i>This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress.</i> As he attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: identity-view, doubt, and grasping at habits &amp; practices.

As he keeps cultivating disenchantment with regard to form... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness, he comprehends form... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness.

<p>The practice leading to disenchantment, dispassion, and release follows a stepwise path of cause and effect.</p>

<h3>Mindfulness &amp; Alertness</h3>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Stay mindful, monks, and alert. This is our instruction to you all. And how is a monk mindful? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This is how a monk is mindful.</p>

<p>"And how is a monk alert? There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Thoughts are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Discernment <i>[vl:</i> perception] is known to him as it arises, known as it persists, known as it subsides. This is how a monk is alert. So stay mindful, monks, and alert. This is our instruction to you all."</p>

<h3>Restraint of the Senses</h3>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses? On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which &mdash; if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye &mdash; evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear... On smelling an odor with the nose... One tasting a flavor with the tongue... On touching a tactile sensation with the body... On cognizing an idea with the intellect, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which &mdash; if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect &mdash; evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless. This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses."</p>

<h3>The Three Forms of Right Conduct</h3>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Now, Cunda, there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action, four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action, and three ways in which one is made pure by mental action.</p>

<p>"And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them. Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct. He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man. This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action.</p>

<p>"And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech. When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering of his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty, if he is asked as a witness, 'Come &amp; tell, good man, what you know': If he doesn't know, he says, 'I don't know.' If he does know, he says, 'I know.' If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward. Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. Abandoning divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he doesn't tell there to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he doesn't tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing &amp; pleasing to people at large. Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, &amp; the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action.</p>

<p>"And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action? There is the case where a certain person is not covetous. He does not covet the belongings of others, thinking, 'O, that what belongs to others would be mine!' He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart. [He thinks,] 'May these beings be free from animosity, free from oppression, free from trouble, and may they look after themselves with ease!' He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things: 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits &amp; results of good &amp; bad actions. There is this world &amp; the next world. There is mother &amp; father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are contemplatives &amp; brahmans who, faring rightly &amp; practicing rightly, proclaim this world &amp; the next after having directly known &amp; realized it for themselves.' This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action.</p>

<p>"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of skillful action."</p>

<h3>The Four Establishings of Mindfulness</h3>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"[1] Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is breathing out long; or breathing in short, discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, discerns that he is breathing out short; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;... out sensitive to the entire body; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out calming bodily fabrication: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this &mdash; the in-&amp;-out breath &mdash; is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"[2] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to rapture; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to pleasure; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to mental fabrication; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out calming mental fabrication: On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>feelings</i> in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this &mdash; close attention to in-&amp;-out breaths &mdash; is classed as a feeling among feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"[3] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to the mind; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out satisfying the mind; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out steadying the mind; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out releasing the mind: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>mind</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I don't say that there is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on dispassion; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on cessation; trains himself to breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>mental qualities</i> in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed &amp; distress is one who oversees with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"This is how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the four establishings of mindfulness to their culmination.</p>

<h3>The Seven Factors for Awakening</h3>

<p>"And how are the four establishings of mindfulness developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination?</p>

<p>"[1] On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady &amp; without lapse. When his mindfulness is steady &amp; without lapse, then <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>"[2] Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment. When he remains mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, &amp; coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>"[3] In one who examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is aroused. When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then <i>persistence</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>"[4] In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises. When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused, then <i>rapture</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>"[5] For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the mind grows calm. When the body &amp; mind of an enraptured monk grow calm, then <i>serenity</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>"[6] For one who is at ease &mdash; his body calmed &mdash; the mind becomes concentrated. When the mind of one who is at ease &mdash; his body calmed &mdash; becomes concentrated, then <i>concentration</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>"[7] He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity. When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, <i>equanimity</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[Similarly with the other three establishings of mindfulness: feelings, mind, &amp; mental qualities.]</p>

<p>"This is how the four establishings of mindfulness are developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination.</p>

<h3>Clear Knowing &amp; Release</h3>

<p>"And how are the seven factors for awakening developed &amp; pursued so as to bring clear knowing &amp; release to their culmination? There is the case where a monk develops <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>persistence</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>rapture</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>serenity</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>concentration</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>equanimity</i> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in relinquishment.</p>

<p>"This is how the seven factors for awakening, when developed &amp; pursued, bring clear knowing &amp; release to their culmination."</p>

<p>The ability to follow this path to completion is not just a matter of mastering technique. It also depends on the ability to develop strong character traits.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Now, what are the eight thoughts of a great person? This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing.

This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy. This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one whose mindfulness is confused. This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated. This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose discernment is weak. This Dhamma is for one who enjoys non-objectification, who delights in non-objectification, not for one who enjoys &amp; delights in objectification.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk, being modest, does not want it to be known that 'He is modest.' Being content, he does not want it to be known that 'He is content.' Being reclusive, he does not want it to be known that 'He is reclusive.' His persistence being aroused, he does not want it to be known that 'His persistence is aroused.' His mindfulness being established, he does not want it to be known that 'His mindfulness is established.' His mind being concentrated, he does not want it to be known that 'His mind is concentrated.' Being endowed with discernment, he does not want it to be known that 'He is endowed with discernment.' Enjoying non-objectification, he does not want it to be known that 'He is enjoying non-objectification.' 'This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing.' Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all, any old almsfood, any old lodging, any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all. 'This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.' Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive, not for one who is entangled.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk, when living in seclusion, is visited by monks, nuns, lay men, lay women, kings, royal ministers, sectarians &amp; their disciples. With his mind bent on seclusion, tending toward seclusion, inclined toward seclusion, aiming at seclusion, relishing renunciation, he converses with them only as much as is necessary for them to take their leave. 'This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive, not for one in entanglement.' Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities. 'This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy.' Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one whose mindfulness is confused.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk is mindful, highly meticulous, remembering &amp; able to call to mind even things that were done &amp; said long ago. 'This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one whose mindfulness is confused.' Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. 'This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated.' Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose discernment is weak.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising &amp; passing away &mdash; noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress. 'This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose discernment is weak.' Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.</p>

<p>"'This Dhamma is for one who enjoys non-objectification, who delights in non-objectification, not for one who enjoys &amp; delights in objectification.' Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk's mind leaps up, grows confident, steadfast, &amp; firm in the cessation of objectification. 'This Dhamma is for one who enjoys non-objectification, who delights in non-objectification, not for one who enjoys &amp; delights in objectification.' Thus was it said.

<p>"A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an unexcelled field of merit for the world. Which seven?

<p>"And how is a monk one with a sense of Dhamma? There is the case where a monk knows the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose &amp; verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question &amp; answer sessions [this is a list of the earliest classifications of the Buddha's teachings].

So it's because he does know the Dhamma &mdash; dialogues... question &amp; answer sessions &mdash; that he is said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. This is one with a sense of Dhamma.</p>

<p>"And how is a monk one with a sense of meaning?

<p>"And how is a monk one with a sense of himself?

This is one with a sense of Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense of himself, a sense of moderation, a sense of time, &amp; a sense of social gatherings.</p>

<p>"And how is a monk one with a sense of distinctions among individuals? There is the case where people are known to a monk in terms of two categories.</p>

<p>"Of two people &mdash; one who wants to see noble ones and one who doesn't &mdash; the one who doesn't want to see noble ones is to be criticized for that reason, the one who does want to see noble ones is, for that reason, to be praised.</p>

<p>"Of two people who want to see noble ones &mdash; one who wants to hear the true Dhamma and one who doesn't &mdash; the one who doesn't want to hear the true Dhamma is to be criticized for that reason, the one who does want to hear the true Dhamma is, for that reason, to be praised.</p>

<p>"Of two people who want to hear the true Dhamma &mdash; one who listens with an attentive ear and one who listens without an attentive ear &mdash; the one who listens without an attentive ear is to be criticized for that reason, the one who listens with an attentive ear is, for that reason, to be praised.</p>

<p>"Of two people who listen with an attentive ear &mdash; one who, having listened to the Dhamma, remembers it, and one who doesn't &mdash; the one who, having listened to the Dhamma, doesn't remember it is to be criticized for that reason, the one who, having listened to the Dhamma, does remember the Dhamma is, for that reason, to be praised.</p>

<p>"Of two people who, having listened to the Dhamma, remember it &mdash; one who explores the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered and one who doesn't &mdash; the one who doesn't explore the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered is to be criticized for that reason, the one who does explore the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered is, for that reason, to be praised.</p>

<p>"Of two people who explore the meaning of the Dhamma they have remembered &mdash; one who practices the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning, and one who doesn't &mdash; the one who doesn't practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning, is to be criticized for that reason, the one who does practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning is, for that reason, to be praised.</p>

<p>"Of two people who practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning &mdash; one who practices for both his own benefit and that of others, and one who practices for his own benefit but not that of others &mdash; the one who practices for his own benefit but not that of others is to be criticized for that reason, the one who practices for both his own benefit and that of others is, for that reason, to be praised.</p>

<p>"This is how people are known to a monk in terms of two categories. And this is how a monk is one with a sense of distinctions among individuals.</p>

<p>"A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an unexcelled field of merit for the world."</p>

<p>To practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma not only makes one worthy of respect, it also is a way of showing respect and gratitude to the Buddha for his admirable friendship in creating the opportunity for hearing the true Dhamma.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Then the Blessed One [on his death-bed] said to Ven. Ananda, "Ananda, the twin sal-trees are in full bloom, even though it's not the flowering season. They shower, strew, &amp; sprinkle on the Tathagata's body in homage to him. Heavenly coral-tree blossoms are falling from the sky... Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky... Heavenly music is playing in the sky... Heavenly songs are sung in the sky, in homage to the Tathagata. But it is not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped, honored, respected, venerated, or paid homage to. Rather, the monk, nun, male lay follower, or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, who keeps practicing masterfully, who lives in accordance with the Dhamma: that is the person who worships, honors, respects, venerates, &amp; pays homage to the Tathagata with the highest homage. So you should train yourselves: 'We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, we will keep practicing masterfully, we will live in accordance with the Dhamma.' That's how you should train yourselves."</p>

<h1><a id='part2'>II: Stream Entry &amp; its Results</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<h2><a id='intro2'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>When treating the experience of stream entry and its results, the Canon uses all three of its typical modes of discourse: the narrative mode &mdash; stories about people who have attained stream entry; the cosmological mode &mdash; descriptions of the after-death destinations awaiting those who have attained stream entry; and what might be called the "emptiness" mode, which describes mental states in and of themselves as they are directly experienced as absent or present, both during and after stream entry.</p>


<p>The material in this part of the study guide is presented in five sections. The first section, <b>The Arising of the Dhamma Eye,</b> discusses the experience of stream entry, and concludes with a passage indicating why the experience is described in terms of the faculty of vision. The second section, <b>The Three Fetters,</b> discusses the three fetters of renewed existence that are cut with the arising of the Dhamma eye: self-identity views, uncertainty, and grasping at habits and practices. The third section, <b>The Character of the Stream-enterer,</b>discusses the personal characteristics of a stream-enterer that flow directly from the cutting of the first three fetters. This section focuses on three lists of the four factors of stream entry, which are not to be confused with the four factors for stream entry discussed in the first part of this study guide. The fourth section, <b>Rewards,</b> discusses the rewards of stream entry that are come both in this life and in future lives. The final section, <b>Advice,</b> echoes the Buddha's last words to his disciples before entering total nibbana. The discourse reporting those words &mdash; DN 16 &mdash; also reports that the most backward of the monks present at the Buddha's passing away were stream-enterers. The fact that his last words to them stressed the need for heedfulness underlies the fact that even stream-enterers have to be wary of heedlessness. This is especially true in the present day, when many different meditation schools define the attainment of stream entry in such different terms, raising the question of whose certification of stream entry is valid and whose is not. The safest course of action for all meditators &mdash; whether certified as stream-enterers or not, and whether that certification is valid or not &mdash; is to maintain an attitude of heedfulness with regard to all mental qualities.</p>



<div class='dingbat'><img src='./../../img/dalberding8.gif' alt='* * *'     /></div>

<p>The term "stream" in "stream entry" refers to the point where all eight factors of the noble eightfold path come together.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Sariputta, 'The stream, the stream': thus it is said. And what, Sariputta, is the stream?"</p>

<p>"This noble eightfold path, lord, is the stream: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sariputta! Very good! This noble eightfold path &mdash; right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration &mdash; is the stream."</p>

<p class='cite'>&mdash; SN 55.5</p></div>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"And what is right view? Knowledge in terms of stress, knowledge in terms of the origination of stress, knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress, knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: This is called right view.</p>

<p>"And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on non-ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right resolve.</p>

<p>"And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, &amp; from idle chatter: This is called right speech.</p>

<p>"And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from sexual intercourse: This is called right action.</p>

<p>"And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood. This is called right livelihood.</p>

<p>"And what is right effort? There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen... for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen... for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen... (and) for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen. This is called right effort.</p>

<p>"And what is right mindfulness? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves... the mind in &amp; of itself... mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This is called right mindfulness.</p>

<p>"And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration."</p>

<p>The coming-together of these factors is called the stream because it leads inevitably to two things, just as the current of a tributary will lead inevitably to a major river and then to the sea. In the immediate present, the stream leads directly to the arising of the Dhamma eye, the vision that actually constitutes this first awakening. Over time, the stream ensures that &mdash; in no more than seven lifetimes &mdash; one will be totally unbound.</p>



<h2><a id='arising'>The Arising of the Dhamma Eye</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>What does the Dhamma eye see when it arises?</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Then Ven. Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the wanderer:</p>

<div class="freeverse">
"Whatever phenomena arise from a cause:
	Their cause
		&amp; their cessation.
Such is the teaching of the Tathagata,
		the Great Contemplative."
</div>

<p>Then to Sariputta the wanderer, as he heard this exposition of Dhamma, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: <i>Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.</i></p>

<p class='cite'>&mdash; Mv I.23.5</p></div>

<p>This standard formula &mdash; it is repeated throughout the Canon &mdash; may not seem that remarkable an insight. However, the texts make clear that this insight is not a matter of belief or contemplation, but of direct seeing. As the following passages show, belief and contemplation may be conducive to the seeing &mdash; and an undefined level of belief and discernment may actually guarantee that someday in this lifetime the seeing will occur &mdash; but only with the actual seeing does there come a dramatic shift in the course of one's life and one's relationship to the Dhamma.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Monks, the eye is inconstant, changeable, alterable. The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body... The mind is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>Forms... Sounds ... Aromas... Flavors... Tactile sensations... Ideas are inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"Eye-consciousness... Ear-consciousness... Nose-consciousness... Tongue-consciousness... Body-consciousness... Intellect-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"Eye-contact...Ear-contact...Nose-contact...Tongue-contact...Body-contact... Intellect-contact is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"Feeling born of eye-contact... Feeling born of ear-contact... Feeling born of nose-contact... Feeling born of tongue-contact... Feeling born of body-contact... Feeling born of intellect-contact is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"Perception of forms... Perception of sounds... Perception of smells... Perception of tastes... Perception of tactile sensations...Perception of ideas is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"Intention for forms... Intention for sounds... Intention for smells... Intention for tastes... Intention for tactile sensations... Intention for ideas is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"Craving for forms... Craving for sounds... Craving for smells... Craving for tastes... Craving for tactile sensations... Craving for ideas is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"The earth property... The liquid property... The fire property... The wind property... The space property... The consciousness property is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"Form... Feeling... Perception... Fabrications... Consciousness is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</p>

<p>"One who has conviction &amp; belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry ghosts. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry.</p>

<p>"One who, after pondering with a modicum of discernment, has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a Dhamma-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry ghosts. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry.</p>

<p>"One who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream-enterer, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening."</p>

<p class='cite'>&mdash; SN 25.1-10</p></div>


<div class="excerpt">
<p>To Upali the householder, as he was sitting right there, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: <i>Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.</i> Then &mdash; having seen the Dhamma, having reached the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, gained a footing in the Dhamma, having crossed over &amp; beyond doubt, having had no more questioning &mdash; Upali the householder gained fearlessness and was independent of others with regard to the Teacher's message.</p>

<p class='cite'>&mdash; MN 56</p></div>

<p>Part of what makes the arising of the Dhamma eye such a powerful experience is that the realization that "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation" must follow on a glimpse of what stands in opposition to "all that is subject to origination," i.e., a glimpse of the Unconditioned &mdash; deathlessness.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>[Immediately after attaining the stream] Sariputta the wanderer went to Moggallana the wanderer. Moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, said, "Your faculties are bright, my friend; your complexion pure &amp; clear. Could it be that you have attained the Deathless?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend, I have..."</p>

<p class='cite'>&mdash; Mv I.23.5</p></div>

<p>The connection between Ven. Assaji's verse above, discussing causation, and the arising of the Dhamma eye in Sariputta suggests that realization conveyed by the Dhamma eye is not just an insight into the fleeting, impermanent nature of ordinary experience. Instead, it extends also to a realization of the conditioned, dependent nature of that experience. Other passages describing in more detail the knowledge of a stream-enterer &mdash; one who has entered the stream &mdash; show that this is in fact the case. The Dhamma eye sees that things arise and pass away in line with a particular type of causality, in which the effects of causes are felt immediately or over the course of time.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"And which is the noble method that he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out through discernment?</p>

<p>"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices:</p>

<p>"When this is, that is.</p>

<p>"From the arising of this comes the arising of that.</p>

<p>"When this isn't, that isn't.</p>

<p>"From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.</p>

<p>"In other words:</p>

<p>"From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.</p>

<p>"From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.</p>

<p>"From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form.</p>

<p>"From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.</p>

<p>"From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.</p>

<p>"From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>

<p>"From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>

<p>"From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>

<p>"From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>

<p>"From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>

<p>"From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</p>

<p>"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</p>

<p>"This is the noble method that he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out through discernment."</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"When a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent co-arising &amp; these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present, it is not possible that he would run after the past, thinking, 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?' or that he would run after the future, thinking, 'Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' or that he would be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present, thinking, 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?' Such a thing is not possible. Why is that? Because the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent co-arising &amp; these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present."</p>

<p>The insight of a stream-enterer into the truths of causality on the one hand, and of the Deathless on the other, is accurate as far as it goes, but it does not equal the intensity of the insight of the arahant &mdash; one who has reached the final level of awakening. The differences between the two are suggested in the following simile.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>[Ven. Narada:] "My friend, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose effluents are ended. It's as if there were a well along a road in a desert, with neither rope nor water bucket. A man would come along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, exhausted, dehydrated, &amp; thirsty. He would look into the well and would have knowledge of 'water,' but he would not dwell touching it with his body. In the same way, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose effluents are ended."</p>

<h2><a id='fetters'>The Three Fetters</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>The four levels of Awakening are defined by the extent to which they cut the ten fetters by which the mind binds itself to conditioned experience.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"And which are the five lower fetters? Self-identity views, uncertainty, grasping at habits &amp; practices, sensual desire, &amp; ill will. These are the five lower fetters. And which are the five higher fetters? Passion for form, passion for what is formless, conceit, restlessness, &amp; ignorance. These are the five higher fetters."</p>

<p>For the stream-enterer, the arising of the Dhamma eye &mdash; with its insight into the causal principles underlying the origination and cessation of stress &mdash; is what cuts through the first three fetters.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"He attends appropriately, <i>This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress...

'My gosh, how long have I been fooled, cheated, &amp; deceived by that man &amp; his grimy, oil-stained rag! &mdash; "Here, my good man, is a white cloth &mdash; beautiful, spotless, &amp; clean."'</p>

<p>"In the same way, Magandiya, if I were to teach you the Dhamma &mdash; this freedom from Disease, this Unbinding &mdash; and you on your part were to understand that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding, then together with the arising of your eyesight, you would abandon whatever passion &amp; delight you felt with regard for the five aggregates for sustenance. And it would occur to you, 'My gosh, how long have I been fooled, cheated, &amp; deceived by this mind! For in clinging, it was just form that I was clinging to...it was just feeling... just perception... just fabrications... just consciousness that I was clinging to. With my clinging as condition, there is becoming... birth... aging &amp; death... sorrow, lamentation, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs all come into play. And thus is the origination of this entire mass of stress.'"</p>

<p>In the following passage, Ven. Khemaka &mdash; a monk who has attained the level of non-returner, and so has cut the first five fetters &mdash; indicates how self-identity views may be cut even though the mind has yet to cut the conceit, "I am," which ends only at the level of full awakening.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>[Ven. Khemaka:] "Friends, it's not that I say 'I am form,' nor do I say 'I am something other than form.' It's not that I say, 'I am feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness,' nor do I say, 'I am something other than consciousness.' With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, 'I am' has not been overcome, although I don't assume that 'I am this.'</p>

<p>"It's just like the scent of a blue, red, or white lotus: If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament, would he be speaking correctly?"</p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<p>"Then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly?"</p>

<p>"As the scent of the flower: That's how he would describe it if he were describing it correctly."</p>

<p><b>The fetter of uncertainty</b> is defined as doubt in the Awakening of the Buddha, the truth of his Dhamma, and the practice of his noble disciples. What this uncertainty boils down to is doubt as to whether there is a Deathless dimension, and whether one can realize it through one's own efforts. The experience of the Deathless &mdash; following on the practice of the Dhamma to the point of entering the stream &mdash; cuts this fetter by confirming the possibility of a human being's awakening to the Deathless, the correctness of the Buddha's teaching as a guide to entering the stream, and the worthiness of those who have reached the stream.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of devas &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>

<p>"He is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.'</p>

<p>"He is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Sangha: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully &mdash; in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types[1] &mdash; they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.'"</p>

<p>NOTE 1. The four pairs are (1) the person on the path to stream entry, the person experiencing the fruit of stream entry; (2) the person on the path to once-returning, the person experiencing the fruit of once-returning; (3) the person on the path to non-returning, the person experiencing the fruit of non-returning; (4) the person on the path to arahantship, the person experiencing the fruit of arahantship.

<p><b>The fetter of grasping at habits and practices</b> is often described in the Pali Canon with reference to the view that one becomes pure simply through performing rituals or patterns of behavior. This view in turn is related to the notion that one's being is defined by one's actions: If one acts in accordance with clearly defined habits and practices, one is <i>ipso facto</i> pure. Although the Canon recognizes the importance of habits and practices in the attaining the stream, the experience of the Deathless shows the person who has attained the stream that one cannot define oneself in terms of those habits and practices. Thus one continues to follow virtuous practices, but without defining oneself in terms of them.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Now where do skillful habits cease without trace? Their cessation, too, has been stated: There is the case where a monk is virtuous, but not fashioned of (or: defined by his) virtue. He discerns, as it actually is, the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release where his skillful habits cease without trace."</p>

<h2><a id='character'>The Character of a Stream-winner</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>A standard formula in the Canon describes a stream-enterer in terms of four factors. The first three of these four factors of stream entry are directly related to the cutting of the fetter of uncertainty. The fourth is related to the cutting of the fetter of grasping at habits and practices.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One... unwavering confidence in the Dhamma... unwavering confidence in the Sangha... He/she is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration."</p>

<p class='cite'>&mdash; <a href='../../tipitaka/an/an10/an10.092.than.html'>AN 10.92</a></p></div>

<p>Although this is the standard list of the four factors of stream entry, there are other lists that replace the fourth factor with other factors.</p>

<p><a href='../../tipitaka/sn/sn55/sn55.032.than.html'>SN 55.32</a> defines the fourth factor as follows: "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones lives at home with an awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous, responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms.</p>

<p><a href='../../tipitaka/sn/sn55/sn55.033.than.html'>SN 55.33</a> defines it as follows: "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising &amp; passing away &mdash; noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress."</p>

<p>When these lists are collated, we arrive at four qualities that describe a stream-enterer: conviction, virtue, generosity, and discernment. AN 8.54 describes these as "four qualities that lead to a lay person's happiness and well-being in lives to come." Other passages in the Canon explore the implications of each of these four as embodied in a stream-enterer's behavior.</p>

<p><b>Conviction</b> in the Triple Gem of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha is not simply a matter of belief or devotion. It forces one to place trust in the principle of kamma &mdash; the principle of action and result in line with which one first gained entry to the stream.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Endowed with these five qualities, a lay follower is a jewel of a lay follower, a lotus of a lay follower, a fine flower of a lay follower. Which five? He/she has conviction; is virtuous; is not eager for protective charms &amp; ceremonies; trusts kamma, not protective charms &amp; ceremonies; does not search for recipients of his/her offerings outside [of the Sangha], and gives offerings here first."</p>

<p class='cite'>&mdash; <a href='../../tipitaka/an/an05/an05.175.than.html'>AN 5.175</a></p></div>

<p><b>Virtue,</b> as practiced by the stream-enterer, is also a function of a deep trust in the principle of kamma, and of a sympathy for others that arises from that trust. Although stream-enterers may still break the minor rules of training, the depth of insight that informs their virtue ensures that their adherence to the basic principles of morality is unshakable.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones reflects thus: 'I love life and don't love death. I love happiness and abhor pain. Now if I &mdash; loving life and not loving death, loving happiness and abhorring pain &mdash; were to be killed, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me. And if I were to kill another who loves life and doesn't love death, who loves happiness and abhors pain, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to the other. What is displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me is displeasing &amp; disagreeable to others. How can I inflict on others what is displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me?' Reflecting in this way, he refrains from taking life, gets others to refrain from taking life, and speaks in praise of refraining from taking life. In this way his bodily behavior is pure in three ways.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, he reflects thus: 'If someone, by way of theft, were to take from me what I haven't given, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me... If someone were to commit adultery with my wives, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me... If someone were to damage my well-being with a lie, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me... If someone were to divide me from my friends with divisive speech, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me... If someone were to address me with harsh speech, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me... If someone were to address me with idle chatter, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me. And if I were to address another with idle chatter, that would be displeasing &amp; disagreeable to the other. What is displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me is displeasing &amp; disagreeable to others. How can I inflict on others what is displeasing &amp; disagreeable to me?' Reflecting in this way, he refrains from idle chatter, gets others to refrain from idle chatter, and speaks in praise of refraining from idle chatter. In this way his verbal behavior is pure in three ways."</p>

<p>"Monks, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every fortnight, in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselves. There are these three trainings under which all that is gathered. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment. These are the three trainings under which all that is gathered.</p>

<p>"There is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue, moderately accomplished in concentration, and moderately accomplished in discernment. With reference to the lesser and minor training rules, he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself. Why is that? Because I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances. But as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life, he is one of permanent virtue, one of steadfast virtue.

<p><b>Discernment</b> is the character trait of the stream-enterer that is most directly related to the cutting of the fetter of self-identity views. However, its implications spread to other facets of right view as well. In fact, "consummate in view" is one of the epithets for a stream-enterer. The impact of being consummate in view extends, not only to one's intellectual life, but also to one's emotional life as well.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, considers thus: 'Is there any internal enthrallment unabandoned in me that, enthralled with which, my enthralled mind would not know or see things as they actually are?' If a monk is enthralled with sensual passion, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled with ill will, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled with sloth and torpor, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled with restlessness and anxiety, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled with uncertainty, then his mind is enthralled. If a monk is absorbed in speculation about this world, then his mind is enthralled. If a monk is absorbed in speculation about the other world, then his mind is enthralled. If a monk is given to arguing and quarreling and disputing, stabbing others with weapons of the mouth, then his mind is enthralled.</p>

<p>"He discerns that, 'There is no enthrallment unabandoned in me that, enthralled with which, my enthralled mind would not know and see things as they actually are. My mind is well directed for awakening to the truths.' This is the first knowledge attained by him that is noble, transcendent, not held in common with run-of-the-mill people.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus: 'When I cultivate, develop, and pursue this view, do I personally obtain serenity, do I personally obtain Unbinding?'</p>

Just as a young, tender infant lying on his back, when he has hit a live ember with his hand or his foot, immediately draws back; in the same way, this is the character of a person consummate in view: although he may commit some kind of offence for which a means of rehabilitation has been laid down, still he immediately confesses, reveals, and discloses it to the Teacher or to wise companions in the holy life; having done that, he undertakes restraint for the future.</p>

<p>"Venerable sirs, I don't know entirely what views the Blessed One has."</p>

<p>"Well, well. So you don't know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama has. Then tell us what views the monks have."</p>

<p>When this had been said, Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers, "As for the venerable one who says, <i>'The cosmos is eternal.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have," his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another. Now this view has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently originated. Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently originated, that is inconstant.

<p>When this was said, a certain man said to Nandaka, the chief minister of the Licchavis, "It is now time for your bath, sir."</p>

<p>[Nandaka responded,] "Enough, I say, with this external bath. I am satisfied with this internal bath: confidence in the Blessed One."</p>

<p>The Canon often places great importance on the power of the last mental state before death in determining one's future plane of existence. However, the power of stream entry is so great that it can overcome even a muddled state of mind at death, ensuring that the next rebirth will be a good one.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>As he was sitting there, Mahanama the Sakyan said to the Blessed One, "Lord, this Kapilavatthu is rich &amp; prosperous, populous &amp; crowded, its alleys congested. Sometimes, when I enter Kapilavatthu in the evening after visiting with the Blessed One or with the monks who inspire the mind, I meet up with a runaway elephant, a runaway horse, a runaway chariot, a runaway cart, or a runaway person. At times like that, my mindfulness with regard to the Blessed One gets muddled, my mindfulness with regard to the Dhamma... the Sangha gets muddled. The thought occurs to me, 'If I were to die at this moment, what would be my destination? What would be my future course?'"</p>

<p>"Have no fear, Mahanama. Have no fear. Your death will not be a bad one, your demise will not be bad. If one's mind has long been nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, nurtured with learning, nurtured with generosity, nurtured with discernment, then when the body &mdash; endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother &amp; father, nourished with rice &amp; porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, &amp; dispersion &mdash; is eaten by crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, hyenas, or all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the mind &mdash; long nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, learning, generosity, &amp; discernment &mdash; rises upward and separates out.</p>

<p>"Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break. There the shards &amp; jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would rise upward and separate out. In the same way, if one's mind has long been nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, nurtured with learning, nurtured with generosity, nurtured with discernment, then when the body... is eaten by crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, hyenas, or all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the mind... rises upward and separates out."</p>

<p>Not all of the rewards of stream entry concern one's fate at death. Many of them pertain also to the here-and-now.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Then Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "When, for a disciple of the noble ones, five forms of fear &amp; animosity are stilled; when he is endowed with the four factors of stream entry; and when, through discernment, he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out the noble method, then if he wants he may state about himself: 'Hell is ended; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry ghosts is ended; states of deprivation, destitution, the bad bourns are ended! I am a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening!'</p>

<p>"Now, which five forms of danger &amp; animosity are stilled?</p>

<p>"When a person takes life, then with the taking of life as a requisite condition, he produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now, produces fear &amp; animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair; but when he refrains from taking life, he neither produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now nor does he produce fear &amp; animosity in future lives, nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair: for one who refrains from taking life, that fear &amp; animosity is thus stilled.</p>

<p>"When a person steals... engages in illicit sex... tells lies...</p>

<p>"When a person drinks distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, then with the drinking of distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness as a requisite condition, he produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now, produces fear &amp; animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair; but when he refrains from drinking distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, he neither produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now nor does he produce fear &amp; animosity in future lives, nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair: for one who refrains from drinking distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, that fear &amp; animosity is thus stilled.</p>

<p>"These are the five rewards of conviction in a lay person. Which five?</p>

<p>"When the truly good people in the world show compassion, they will first show compassion to people of conviction, and not to people without conviction. When visiting, they first visit people of conviction, and not people without conviction. When accepting gifts, they will first accept those from people with conviction, and not from people without conviction.

<p>Although it would be pleasant to conclude this study guide with the above passages of encouragement, we would probably do better to follow the example of the Buddha, who directed his last words to his stream-enterer disciples, encouraging them not to rest content with the rewards awaiting them, but to maintain instead an attitude of heedfulness.</p>

	<dd>Effluent; fermentation. Four qualities &mdash; sensuality, views, becoming, and ignorance &mdash; that "flow out" of the mind and create the flood of the round of death and rebirth.</dd>

<dt>Deva (devata):</dt>
	<dd>Literally, "shining one." An inhabitant of the heavenly realms.</dd>

<dt>Dhamma:</dt>
	<dd>(1) Event; action; (2) a phenomenon in and of itself; (3) mental quality; (4) doctrine, teaching; (5) nibbana (although there are passages describing nibbana as the abandoning of all dhammas). Sanskrit form: <i>Dharma.</i></dd>

<dt>Jhana:</dt>
	<dd>Mental absorption. A state of strong concentration focused on a single sensation or mental notion. This term is derived from the verb <i>jhayati,</i> which means to burn with a still, steady flame.</dd>

<dt>Kamma:</dt>
	<dd>Intentional act. Sanskrit form: <i>Karma.</i></dd>

<dt>Nibbana:</dt>
	<dd>Literally, the "unbinding" of the mind from passion, aversion, and delusion, and from the entire round of death and rebirth. As this term also denotes the extinguishing of a fire, it carries connotations of stilling, cooling, and peace. "Total nibbana" in some contexts denotes the experience of Awakening; in others, the final passing away of an arahant. Sanskrit form: <i>Nirvana.</i></dd>

<dt>Sangha:</dt>
	<dd>Community. On the conventional <i>(sammati)</i> level, this term denotes the communities of Buddhist monks and nuns. On the ideal <i>(ariya)</i> level, it denotes those followers of the Buddha, lay or ordained, who have attained at least stream entry.</dd>

<dt>Tathagata:</dt>
	<dd>Literally, "one who has become authentic <i>(tatha-agata)"</i> or "one who is truly gone <i>(tatha-gata)."</i> An epithet used in ancient India for a person who has attained the highest religious goal.
