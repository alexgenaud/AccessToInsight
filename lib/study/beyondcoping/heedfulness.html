<p><b><a id="sect-35">&sect;35.</a></b> There are these five facts that one should reflect on often, whether one is a woman or a man, lay or ordained. Which five?</p>
<p>"I am subject to aging, have not gone beyond aging." This is the first fact that one should reflect on often...</p>
<p>"I am subject to illness, have not gone beyond illness"...</p>
<p>"I am subject to death, have not gone beyond death"...</p>
<p>"I will grow different, separate from all that is dear and appealing to me"...</p>
<p>"I am the owner of my actions (kamma), heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir"...</p>
<p>These are the five facts that one should reflect on often, whether one is a woman or a man, lay or ordained.</p>
<p>Now, based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect... that "I am subject to aging, have not gone beyond aging"? There are beings who are intoxicated with a [typical] youth's intoxication with youth. Because of that intoxication with youth, they conduct themselves in a bad way in body... in speech... and in mind. But when they often reflect on that fact, that youth's intoxication with youth will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker...</p>
<p>Now, based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect... that "I am subject to illness, have not gone beyond illness"? There are beings who are intoxicated with a [typical] healthy person's intoxication with health. Because of that intoxication with health, they conduct themselves in a bad way in body... in speech... and in mind. But when they often reflect on that fact, that healthy person's intoxication with health will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker...</p>
<p>Now, based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect... that "I am subject to death, have not gone beyond death"? There are beings who are intoxicated with a [typical] living person's intoxication with life. Because of that intoxication with life, they conduct themselves in a bad way in body... in speech... and in mind. But when they often reflect on that fact, that living person's intoxication with life will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker...</p>
<p>Now, based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect... that "I will grow different, separate from all that is dear and appealing to me"? There are beings who feel desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing. Because of that passion, they conduct themselves in a bad way in body... in speech... and in mind. But when they often reflect on that fact, that desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker...</p>
<p>Now, based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect... that "I am the owner of my actions <i>(kamma),</i> heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir"? There are beings who conduct themselves in a bad way in body... in speech... and in mind. But when they often reflect on that fact, that bad conduct in body, speech, and mind will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker...</p>
<p>Now, a disciple of the noble ones considers this: "I am not the only one subject to aging, who has not gone beyond aging. To the extent that there are beings &mdash; past and future, passing away and re-arising &mdash; all beings are subject to aging, have not gone beyond aging." When he/she often reflects on this, the [factors of the] path take birth. He/she sticks with that path, develops it, cultivates it. As he/she sticks with that path, develops it and cultivates it, the fetters are abandoned, the obsessions destroyed.</p>
<p>Further, a disciple of the noble ones considers this: "I am not the only one subject to illness, who has not gone beyond illness"... "I am not the only one subject to death, who has not gone beyond death"... "I am not the only one who will grow different, separate from all that is dear and appealing to me"...</p>

"Subject to birth, subject to aging,
	subject to death,
run-of-the-mill people
are repelled by those who suffer
from that to which they are subject.
And if I were to be repelled

<p><b><a id="sect-36">&sect;36.</a></b> "Monks, I lived in refinement, utmost refinement, total refinement. My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace: one where red-lotuses bloomed, one where white lotuses bloomed, one where blue lotuses bloomed, all for my sake. I used no sandalwood that was not from Varanasi. My turban was from Varanasi, as were my tunic, my lower garments, &amp; my outer cloak. A white sunshade was held over me day &amp; night to protect me from cold, heat, dust, dirt, &amp; dew.</p>
<p>"I had three palaces: one for the cold season, one for the hot season, one for the rainy season. During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainy-season palace by minstrels without a single man among them, and I did not once come down from the palace. Whereas the servants, workers, &amp; retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup &amp; broken rice, in my father's home the servants, workers, &amp; retainers were fed wheat, rice, and meat.</p>
<p>"Even though I was endowed with such fortune, such total refinement, the thought occurred to me: 'When an untaught, run-of-the-mill person, himself subject to aging, not beyond aging, sees another who is aged, he is horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted, oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging, not beyond aging. If I &mdash; who am subject to aging, not beyond aging &mdash; were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is aged, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the [typical] young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away.</p>

And if I &mdash; who am subject to illness, not beyond illness &mdash; were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is ill, that would not be fitting for me.'

<div class="verse">
<p class="spkr">[Ven. Ratthapala:]</p>
<pre>
I see in the world
	people with wealth
who, from delusion,
	don't make a gift
	of the treasure they've gained.
Greedy, they stash it away,
hoping for even more
sensual pleasures.

A king who, by force,
has conquered the world
and rules over the earth
to the edge of the sea,
dissatisfied with the ocean's near shore,
	longs for the ocean's
	far shore as well.

Kings &amp; others
	&mdash; plenty of people &mdash;
go to death with craving
	unabated. Unsated
they leave the body behind,
having not had enough
of the world's sensual pleasures.

One's relatives weep
&amp; pull out their hair.
'Oh woe, our loved one is dead,' they cry.
Carrying him off,
wrapped in a piece of cloth,
they place him
	on a pyre,
	then set him on fire.

So he burns, poked with sticks,
in just one piece of cloth,
leaving all his possessions behind.
They are not shelters for one who has died &mdash;
	not relatives,
	friends,
	or companions.

His heirs take over his wealth,
while the being goes on,
in line with his kamma.
No wealth at all
follows the dead one &mdash;
	not children, wives,
	dominion, or riches.

Long life
can't be gotten with wealth,
nor aging
warded off with treasure.
The wise say this life
is next to nothing &mdash;
	impermanent,
	subject to change.

The rich &amp; the poor
touch the touch of Death.
The foolish &amp; wise
are touched by it, too.
But while fools lie as if slain by their folly,
the wise don't tremble
when touched by the touch.

Thus the discernment by which
one attains to mastery,
is better than wealth &mdash;
for those who haven't reached mastery
go from existence to existence,
	out of delusion,
	doing bad deeds.

One goes to a womb
&amp; to the next world,
falling into the wandering on
	&mdash; one thing
	after another &mdash;
while those of weak discernment,
	trusting in one,
also go to a womb
&amp; to the next world.

Just as an evil thief
caught at the break-in
	is destroyed
	by his own act,
so evil people
&mdash; after dying, in the next world &mdash;
	are destroyed
	by their own acts.

Sensual pleasures &mdash;
	variegated,
	enticing,
	sweet &mdash;
in various ways disturb the mind.
Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects:
that's why, O king, I went forth.

Just like fruits, people fall
	&mdash; young &amp; old &mdash;
at the break-up of the body.
Knowing this, O king,
	I went forth.
The contemplative life is better
		for sure.

<pre>
Going forth through conviction
from home into homelessness,
I wandered this place &amp; that,
greedy for gain &amp; offerings.
Missing out on the foremost goal,
I pursued a lowly one.
Under the sway of defilements
I surrendered the goal
of the contemplative life.
Then, sitting in my dwelling,
I suddenly came to my senses:

		<i>I'm following a miserable path.
			I'm under the sway of
				craving.
			Next to nothing, my life,
					crushed
			by aging &amp; illness.
			Before the body breaks apart,
			I have no time

After watching, as it actually was,
the rising &amp; falling of aggregates,
I stood up with mind released,
the Awakened One's bidding
		done.

<p>"Just now, lord, I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of head-anointed noble-warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty, obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures, who have attained stable control in their country, and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth."</p>
<p>"What do you think, great king? Suppose a man, trustworthy &amp; reliable, were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say: 'If it please your majesty, you should know that I come from the east.

Then a second man were to come to you from the west... Then a third man were to come to you from the north... Then a fourth man were to come to you from the south and on arrival would say: 'If it please your majesty, you should know that I come from the south.

<p>"If, lord, such a great peril should arise, such a terrible destruction of human life &mdash; the human state being so hard to obtain &mdash; what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious deeds?"</p>

<p>"As aging &amp; death are rolling in on me, lord, what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious deeds?</p>
<p>"There are, lord, elephant battles [fought by] head-anointed noble-warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty, obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures, who have attained stable control in their country, and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth; but there is no use for those elephant battles, no scope for them, when aging &amp; death are rolling in. There are cavalry battles... chariot battles... infantry battles... but there is no use for those infantry battles, no scope for them, when aging &amp; death are rolling in. In this royal court there are counsellors who, when the enemies arrive, are capable of dividing them by their wits; but there is no use for those battles of wits, no scope for them, when aging &amp; death are rolling in.

<div class='freeverse'>
Like massive boulders,
mountains pressing against the sky,
moving in from all sides,
crushing the four directions,
	so aging and death
come rolling over living beings:
noble warriors, brahmans, merchants,
workers, outcastes, &amp; scavengers.
They spare nothing.
They trample everything.

Here elephant troops can hold no ground,
nor can chariots or infantry,
nor can a battle of wits
or wealth win out.

So a wise person,
seeing his own good,
steadfast, secures confidence
in the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha.

One who practices the Dhamma
in thought, word, &amp; deed,
receives praise here on earth
and after death rejoices in heaven.

One would not chase after the past,
nor place expectations on the future.
What is past
	is left behind.
The future
	is as yet unreached.
Whatever quality is present
one clearly sees 	right there,
	right there.
Unvanquished, unshaken,
that's how one develops the mind.

Ardently doing one's duty today,
for &mdash; who knows? &mdash; tomorrow
	death may come.
There is no bargaining
with Death &amp; his mighty horde.

Whoever lives thus ardently,
	relentlessly
	both day &amp; night,
has truly had an auspicious day:
So says the Peaceful Sage.

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="sect-60">&sect;60.</a></b> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha, at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Ground.</p>
<p>At that time Ven. Rahula<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-60-1' id='fnt-60-1'>[1]</a> was staying at the Mango Stone. Then the Blessed One, arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to where Ven. Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone. Ven. Rahula saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, set out a seat &amp; water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and, having sat down, washed his feet. Ven. Rahula, bowing down to the Blessed One, sat to one side.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having left a little bit of water in the water dipper, said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see this little bit of left-over water remaining in the water dipper?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir."</p>
<p>"That's how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie."</p>
<p>Having tossed away the little bit of left-over water, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how this little bit of left-over water is tossed away?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Whatever there is of a contemplative<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-60-2' id='fnt-60-2'>[2]</a> in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that."</p>
<p>Having turned the water dipper upside down, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that."</p>
<p>Having turned the water dipper right-side up, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how empty &amp; hollow this water dipper is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty &amp; hollow just like that.</p>
<p>"Rahula, it's like a royal elephant: immense, pedigreed, accustomed to battles, its tusks like chariot poles. Having gone into battle, it uses its forefeet &amp; hindfeet, its forequarters &amp; hindquarters, its head &amp; ears &amp; tusks &amp; tail, but will simply hold back its trunk. The elephant trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king.' But when the royal elephant... having gone into battle, uses its forefeet &amp; hindfeet, its forequarters &amp; hindquarters, its head &amp; ears &amp; tusks &amp; tail &amp; his trunk, the trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king. There is nothing it will not do.'</p>
<p>"The same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie: There is no evil, I tell you, he will not do. Thus, Rahula, you should train yourself, 'I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest.'</p>
<p>"What do you think, Rahula: What is a mirror for?"</p>
<p>"For reflection, sir."</p>
<p>"In the same way, Rahula, bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection.</p>
<p>"Whenever you want to perform a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I want to perform &mdash; would it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences, happy results, then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do.</p>
<p>"While you are performing a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I am doing &mdash; is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to affliction of others, or both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.</p>
<p>"Having performed a bodily act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should confess it, reveal it, lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life. Having confessed it... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed &amp; joyful, training day &amp; night in skillful mental qualities.</p>
<p>(Similarly with verbal acts)</p>
<p>"Whenever you want to perform a mental act, you should reflect on it: 'This mental act I want to perform &mdash; would it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful mental act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful mental act with painful consequences, painful results, then any mental act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful mental action with happy consequences, happy results, then any mental act of that sort is fit for you to do.</p>
<p>"While you are performing a mental act, you should reflect on it: 'This mental act I am doing &mdash; is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful mental act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.</p>
<p>"Having performed a mental act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should feel distressed, ashamed, &amp; disgusted with it. Feeling distressed... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed &amp; joyful, training day &amp; night in skillful mental qualities.</p>
<p>"Rahula, all those brahmans &amp; contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"All those brahmans &amp; contemplatives in the course of the future who will purify their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"All those brahmans &amp; contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"Thus, Rahula, you should train yourself: 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection.' That's how you should train yourself."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

	<dd><i>Sama&ntilde;&ntilde;a.</i> Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and acts. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments were metaphors for good. In Pali, the term <i>sama</i> &mdash; "even" &mdash; described an instrument tuned on-pitch. There is a famous passage where the Buddha reminds Sona Kolivisa &mdash; who had been over-exerting himself in the practice &mdash; that a lute sounds appealing only if the strings are neither too taut or too lax, but "evenly" tuned. This image would have special resonance with the Buddha's teaching on the middle way. It also adds meaning to the term <i>samana</i> &mdash; monk or contemplative &mdash; which the texts frequently mention as being derived from <i>sama.</i> The word <i>sama&ntilde;&ntilde;a</i> &mdash; "evenness," the quality of being in tune &mdash; also means the quality of being a contemplative: the true contemplative is always in tune with what is proper and good.</dd>

When a house is on fire,
the vessel salvaged

So when the world is on fire

one should salvage [one's wealth] by giving:
	what's given is well salvaged.

What's given bears fruit as pleasure.
What isn't given does not:
	thieves take it away, or kings;
	it gets burnt by fire or lost.

Then in the end
one leaves the body
together with one's possessions.
Knowing this, the intelligent man
enjoys possessions &amp; gives.
Having enjoyed &amp; given
in line with his means,
	uncensured he goes

Then it occurred to me: 'Those who engage in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct are not dear to themselves. Even though they may say, "We are dear to ourselves," still they aren't dear to themselves. Why is that? Of their own accord, they act toward themselves as an enemy would act toward an enemy; thus they aren't dear to themselves. But those who engage in good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, &amp; good mental conduct are dear to themselves. Even though they may say, "We aren't dear to ourselves," still they are dear to themselves. Why is that?

<p>"That's the way it is, great king! That's the way it is! Those who engage in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct are not dear to themselves.

"If you hold yourself dear

what's truly your own?

<p><b><a id="sect-65">&sect;65.</a></b> As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Just now, lord, while I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in my awareness: 'Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated &amp; heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings. Many more are those who, when acquiring lavish wealth, become intoxicated &amp; heedless, become greedy for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings.'"</p>
<p>"That's the way it is, great king! That's the way it is! Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated &amp; heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings. Many more are those who, when acquiring lavish wealth, become intoxicated &amp; heedless, become greedy for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
"Impassioned with 	sensual possessions,
greedy, dazed by 	sensual pleasures,
they don't awaken to the fact

<p>"And what is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress, knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with regard to the stopping of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the stopping of stress: This, monks, is called right view.</p>
<p>"And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This, monks, is called right resolve.</p>
<p>"And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from abusive speech, abstaining from idle chatter: This, monks, is called right speech.</p>
<p>"And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from unchastity: This, monks, is called right action.</p>
<p>"And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This, monks, is called right livelihood.</p>
<p>"And what is right effort? (i) There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen. (ii) He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen. (iii) He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen. (iv) He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: This, monks, is called right effort.</p>
<p>"And what is right mindfulness? (i) There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, aware, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. (ii) He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, aware, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. (iii) He remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, aware, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. (iv) He remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, aware, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This, monks, is called right mindfulness.</p>
<p>"And what is right concentration? (i) There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. (ii) With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. (iii) With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' (iv) With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This, monks, is called right concentration."</p>
