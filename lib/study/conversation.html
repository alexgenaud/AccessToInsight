<h1><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h1>
<div class="excerpt">
<i>"This is the purpose for conversation, this is the purpose for consultation, this is the purpose of apprenticeship, this is the purpose for lending ear: the liberation of the mind through non-clinging."</i>
</div>
<p>This quotation from chapter 12 of the Parivara, the appendix to the Vinaya, is obviously not talking about ordinary conversation. It's talking about the ideal type of conversation among meditators, the very opposite of idle chatter:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<i>Abandoning idle chatter, one abstains from idle chatter. One speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, &amp; the Vinaya. One speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal.</i>
</div>
<p>Several passages in the Canon list ten ideal topics for such conversation: <a href="#modesty">modesty</a>, <a href="#contentment">contentment</a>, <a href="#seclusion">seclusion</a>, <a href="#non-entanglement">non-entanglement</a>, <a href="#persistence">arousing persistence</a>, <a href="#virtue">virtue</a>, <a href="#concentration">concentration</a>, <a href="#discernment">discernment</a>, <a href="#release">release</a>, and the <a href="#knowledge">knowledge &amp; vision of release</a>. The purpose of this study guide is to illustrate each of these topics with passages from the Canon, and to provide meditators with the incentive to integrate conversation of this sort into their practice. There is some overlap between the topics listed here and those listed in two other study guides: <i><a href="recognizing.html">Recognizing the Dhamma</a></i> and <i><a href="perfections.html">The Ten Perfections</a>.</i> Thus some redundancy has been inevitable, but wherever possible I have also included material unavailable in those two guides.</p>
<p>The first passage included here, in addition to listing the ten ideal topics, also lists topics that monks and serious meditators should avoid, ranging from politics and food to theories about the creation of the world. The Commentary qualifies this list, saying that if one discusses these topics in a way connected with Dhamma &mdash; for example, pointing out the ephemeral nature of political power so as to engender a feeling of dispassion for it &mdash; then that would count as right speech, and an aid to the liberation of the mind.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-1">&sect; 1.</a></b> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, had gathered at the meeting hall and were engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation: conversation about kings, robbers, &amp; ministers of state; armies, alarms, &amp; battles; food &amp; drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, &amp; scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women &amp; heroes; the gossip of the street &amp; the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the world &amp; of the sea; talk of whether things exist or not.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the meeting hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready. As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: "For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here? In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted?"</p>
<p>"Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we gathered at the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation: conversation about kings, robbers, &amp; ministers of state; armies, alarms, &amp; battles; food &amp; drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, &amp; scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women &amp; heroes; the gossip of the street &amp; the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the world &amp; of the sea; talk of whether things exist or not."</p>
<p>"It isn't right, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should get engaged in such topics of conversation, i.e., conversation about kings, robbers, &amp; ministers of state... talk of whether things exist or not.</p>
<p>"There are these ten topics of [proper] conversation. Which ten? Talk on modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge &amp; vision of release. These are the ten topics of conversation. If you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of conversation, you would outshine even the sun &amp; moon, so mighty, so powerful &mdash; to say nothing of the wanderers of other sects."</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-4">&sect; 4.</a></b> On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="alavi">Alavi</a> at the <a id="aggalava">Aggalava Shrine</a>. There he addressed the monks: "Monks, remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with seven amazing, astounding qualities. Which seven? Monks, Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction. He is virtuous. He has a sense of conscience. He has a sense of concern (for the results of unskillful actions). He is learned. He is generous. He is discerning. Remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with these seven amazing, astounding qualities."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, the One Well-going, getting up from his seat, went into his dwelling.</p>
<p>Then early in the morning a certain monk, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe, went to Hatthaka of Alavi's home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Then Hatthaka of Alavi approached the monk and, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the monk said to him, "Friend, the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with seven amazing, astounding qualities. Which seven? 'Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction. He is virtuous. He has a sense of conscience. He has a sense of concern (for the results of unskillful actions). He is learned. He is generous. He is discerning.' Friend, the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with these seven amazing, astounding qualities."</p>
<p>"I hope, sir, that there were no white-clad householders there."</p>
<p>"No, friend, there were no white-clad householders there."</p>
<p>"It's good, sir, that there were no white-clad householders there."</p>
<p>Then the monk, having received alms at Hatthaka of Alavi's home, departed. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, [he told the Blessed One what had happened.]</p>
<p>[The Blessed One replied:] "It's good, monk, it's very good that the clansman is modest and does not want others to know of the skillful qualities present in him. In that case, monk, remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with this eighth amazing, astounding quality: modesty."</p>

Coming down from my dwelling place,
I entered the city for alms,
stood courteously next to a leper

He, with his rotting hand,
tossed me a morsel of food,
and as the morsel was dropping,
a finger fell off
	right there.

Sitting next to a wall,
I ate that morsel of food,

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-9">&sect; 9.</a></b> On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi on a spread of leaves by a cattle track in a simsapa forest. Then Hatthaka of Alavi, out roaming &amp; rambling for exercise, saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by the cattle track in the simsapa forest. On seeing him, he went to him and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, I hope the Blessed One has slept in ease."</p>
<p>"Yes, young man. I have slept in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, I am one."</p>
<p>"But cold, lord, is the winter night. The 'Between-the-Eights' is a time of snowfall. Hard is the ground trampled by cattle hooves. Thin is the spread of leaves. Sparse are the leaves in the trees. Thin are your ochre robes. And cold blows the Verambha wind. Yet still the Blessed One says, 'Yes, young man. I have slept in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, I am one.'"</p>
<p>"In that case, young man, I will question you in return. Answer as you see fit. Now, what do you think: Suppose a householder or householder's son has a house with a gabled roof, plastered inside &amp; out, draft-free, with close-fitting door &amp; windows shut against the wind. Inside he has a horse-hair couch spread with a long-fleeced coverlet, a white wool coverlet, an embroidered coverlet, a rug of kadali-deer hide, with a canopy above, &amp; red cushions on either side. And there a lamp would be burning, and his four wives, with their many charms, would be attending to him. Would he sleep in ease, or not? Or how does this strike you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord, he would sleep in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, he would be one."</p>
<p>"But what do you think, young man. Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion... aversion... delusion so that &mdash; burned with those passion-, aversion-, delusion-born fevers &mdash; he would sleep miserably?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"As for those passion-, aversion-, delusion-born fevers &mdash; burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably &mdash; that passion... aversion... delusion has been abandoned by the Tathagata, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. Therefore he sleeps in ease."</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
Always, always,
he sleeps in ease:
the brahmin totally unbound,
who doesn't adhere
to sensual pleasures,
who's without acquisitions
	&amp; cooled.

Having	 cut all ties
	   &amp; subdued fear in the heart,
calmed,
he sleeps in ease,
	   having reached peace

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-10">&sect; 10.</a></b> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Anupiya in the Mango Orchard. Now at that time, Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, would repeatedly exclaim, "What bliss! What bliss!" A large number of monks heard Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, repeatedly exclaim, "What bliss! What bliss!" and on hearing him, the thought occurred to them, "There's no doubt but that Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life, for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship, so that now, on recollecting that, he is repeatedly exclaiming, 'What bliss! What bliss!'" They went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they told him: "Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha, lord, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, repeatedly exclaims, 'What bliss! What bliss!' There's no doubt but that Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life, for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship, so that now, on recollecting that, he is repeatedly exclaiming, 'What bliss! What bliss!'"</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, "Come, monk. In my name, call Bhaddiya, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'"...</p>
<p>Then Ven. Bhaddiya went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Is it true, Bhaddiya that, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, you repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"What meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'?"</p>
<p>"Before, when I was a householder, maintaining the bliss of kingship, I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments, within and without the city, within and without the countryside. But even though I was thus guarded, thus protected, I dwelled in fear &mdash; agitated, distrustful, and afraid. But now, on going alone to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, I dwell without fear, unagitated, confident, and unafraid &mdash; unconcerned, unruffled, my wants satisfied, with my mind like a wild deer. This is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'"</p>
<p>Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
In whom there exists
no provocation,
&amp; for whom becoming &amp; non-becoming
	are overcome,
he is one &mdash;   beyond fear,
	   blissful,

Renouncing violence
for all living beings,
harming not even a one,
you would not wish for offspring,
	so how a companion?
Wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

For a sociable person
there are allurements;
on the heels of allurement, this pain.
Seeing allurement's drawback,
wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

One whose mind
is enmeshed in sympathy
for friends &amp; companions,
neglects the true goal.
Seeing this danger in intimacy,
wander alone, like a rhinoceros...

   If you gain a mature companion,
	a fellow traveler, right-living &amp; wise,
	overcoming all dangers
	   go with him, gratified,
	   mindful.

   If you don't gain a mature companion,
	a fellow traveler, right-living &amp; wise,
	   go alone
	like a king renouncing his kingdom,
	like the elephant in the Matanga wilds,
	   his herd.

We praise companionship
	&mdash; yes!
Those on a par, or better,
should be chosen as friends.
If they're not to be found,
	living faultlessly,
wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

Seeing radiant bracelets of gold,
well-made by a smith,
	clinking, clashing,
	two on an arm,
wander alone, like a rhinoceros,

[Thinking:] "In the same way,
if I were to live with another,
there would be careless talk or abusive."
Seeing this future danger,
wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

Because sensual pleasures,
elegant, honeyed, &amp; charming,
bewitch the mind with their manifold forms &mdash;
seeing this drawback in sensual strands &mdash;
wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

"Calamity, tumor, misfortune,
disease, an arrow, a danger for me."
Seeing this danger in sensual strands,
	wander alone, like a rhinoceros...

Avoid the evil companion
	disregarding the goal,
	intent on the out-of-tune way.
Don't take as a friend
someone heedless &amp; hankering.
Wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

Consort with one who is learned,
	who maintains the Dhamma,
	a great &amp; quick-witted friend.
Knowing the meanings,
subdue your perplexity,
[then] wander alone, like a rhinoceros...

Unstartled,	like a lion at sounds.
Unsnared,   like the wind in a net.
Unsmeared,  like a lotus in water:
wander alone, like a rhinoceros...

At the right time consorting
with the release through good will,
		   compassion,
		   appreciation,
		   equanimity,
unobstructed by all the world,
	   any world,
wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

Having let go of passion,
		   aversion,
		   delusion;
having shattered	the fetters;
undisturbed	 at the ending of life,
wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

People follow &amp; associate
	for a motive.
Friends without a motive these days
	are rare.
They're shrewd for their own ends, &amp; impure.
	Wander alone, like a rhinoceros.

<p>"But how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone?"</p>
<p>"Lord, alone I enter the village for alms, alone I return, alone I sit withdrawn [in meditation], alone I do walking meditation. That is how I live alone and extol the virtues of living alone."</p>
<p>"There is that way of living alone, Elder. I don't say that there isn't. Still, listen well to how your living alone is perfected in its details, and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
<p>"As you say, lord," Ven. Elder responded.</p>
<p>The Blessed One said: "And how is living alone perfected in its details? There is the case where whatever is past is abandoned, whatever is future is relinquished, and any passion &amp; desire with regard to states of being attained in the present is well subdued. That is how living alone is perfected in its details."</p>

<pre>
To me &mdash;
	resolute in exertion
	near the river Nera&ntilde;jara,
making a great effort,
	doing jhana
	to attain rest from the yoke &mdash;

Namuci<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20-1' id='fnt-20-1'>[1]</a> came,
	speaking words of compassion:
"You are ashen, thin.
Death is in
your presence.
Death
has 1,000 parts of you.
Only one part
is your life.
Live, good sir!
Life is better.

	   Alive,

acts of merit.
Your living the holy life,
performing the fire sacrifice,
will heap up much merit.
	What use is exertion to you?
Hard to follow
 &mdash; the path of exertion &mdash;
hard to do, hard
to sustain."

Saying these verses,
Mara stood in the Awakened One's presence.
And to that Mara, speaking thus,
the Blessed One
said this:

"Kinsman of the heedless,
	Evil One,
come here for whatever purpose:
I haven't, for merit,
even the least bit of need.
Those who have need of merit:
those are the ones
Mara's fit to address.

In me are  conviction
	   austerity,
	   persistence,
	   discernment.
Why, when I'm so resolute
do you petition me
	to live?
This wind could burn up
even river currents.
Why, when I'm resolute,
shouldn't my blood dry away?
As my blood dries up
gall &amp; phlegm dry up.
As muscles waste away,
the mind grows clearer;
mindfulness, discernment,
concentration stand
	more firm.
Staying in this way,
attaining the ultimate feeling,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20-2' id='fnt-20-2'>[2]</a> 
the mind has no interest
in sensual passions.
	See:
	a being's

Sensual passions are your first army.
Your second	 is called Discontent.
Your third	  is Hunger &amp; Thirst.
Your fourth	 is called Craving.
Fifth		   is Sloth &amp; Torpor.
Sixth		   is called Terror.
Your seventh	is Uncertainty.
Hypocrisy &amp; Stubbornness, your eighth.
Gains, Offerings, Fame, &amp; Status
	wrongly gained,
and whoever would praise self
&amp; disparage others.

That, Namuci, is your army,
the Dark One's commando force.
A coward can't defeat it,
but one having defeated it
	gains bliss.
Do <i>I</i> carry mu&ntilde;ja grass?<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20-3' id='fnt-20-3'>[3]</a> 
I spit on my life.
Death in battle would be better for me
	than that I, defeated,
	   survive.

Sinking here, they don't appear,
	some brahmans &amp; contemplatives.
They don't know the path
by which those with good practices
	   go.

Seeing the bannered force
	on all sides &mdash;
the troops, Mara
along with his mount &mdash;
I go into battle.
May they not budge me
	from
	my spot.
That army of yours,
that the world with its devas
	can't overcome,
I will smash		with discernment &mdash;
as an unfired pot   with a stone.

Making	 my resolve mastered,
	   mindfulness well-established,
I will go about, from kingdom to kingdom,
training many disciples.
They &mdash; heedful, resolute,
doing my bidding &mdash;
despite your wishes, will go
	where, having gone,
	there's no grief."

<p>And how is a monk skilled in reading his own mind? Imagine a young woman &mdash; or man &mdash; fond of adornment, examining the image of her own face in a bright, clean mirror or bowl of clear water: If she saw any dirt or blemish there, she would try to remove it. If she saw no dirt or blemish there, she would be pleased, her resolves fulfilled: 'How fortunate I am! How clean I am!' In the same way, a monk's self-examination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities [if he conducts it in this way]: Do I usually remain covetous or not? With thoughts of ill will or not? Overcome by sloth &amp; drowsiness or not? Restless or not? Uncertain or gone beyond uncertainty? Angry or not? With soiled thoughts or unsoiled thoughts? With my body aroused or unaroused? Lazy or with persistence aroused? Unconcentrated or concentrated?'</p>
<p>If, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain covetous, with thoughts of ill will, overcome by sloth &amp; drowsiness, restless, uncertain, angry, with soiled thoughts, with my body aroused, lazy, or unconcentrated,' then he should put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, undivided mindfulness, &amp; alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil, unskillful qualities, just as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, undivided mindfulness, &amp; alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head...</p>
<p>But if, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain uncovetous, without thoughts of ill will... &amp; concentrated,' then his duty is to make an effort in establishing ('tuning') those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents.</p>

Slow is the arising of his mindfulness, but then he quickly abandons [those memories &amp; resolves], destroys them, dispels them, &amp; wipes them out of existence. Just as when two or three drops of water fall onto an iron pan heated all day: Slow is the falling of the drops of water, but they quickly vanish &amp; disappear. In the same way... slow is the arising of his mindfulness, but then he quickly abandons [those memories &amp; resolves], destroys them, dispels them, &amp; wipes them out of existence. I tell you, Udayin, that this sort of person is associated, not dissociated. Why is that? Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person.</p>
<p>Again, there is the case where a certain person, realizing that acquisitions are the root of suffering &amp; stress, is without acquisitions, released in the ending of acquisitions.

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-27">&sect; 27.</a></b> As Ven. Sona was meditating in seclusion [after doing walking meditation until the skin of his soles was split &amp; bleeding], this train of thought arose in his awareness: "Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence, I am one, but my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging/sustenance. Now, my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth &amp; make merit. What if I were to disavow the training, return to the lower life, and to enjoy wealth &amp; make merit?"</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in Ven. Sona's awareness &mdash; as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm &mdash; disappeared from Mount Vulture Peak, appeared in the Cool Wood right in front of Ven. Sona, and sat down on a prepared seat. Ven. Sona, after bowing down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Just now, as you were meditating in seclusion, didn't this train of thought appear to your awareness: 'Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence, I am one, but my mind is not released from the effluents... What if I were to disavow the training, return to the lower life, and to enjoy wealth &amp; make merit?'"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"Now what do you think, Sona. Before, when you were a house-dweller, were you skilled at playing the vina?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"...And when the strings of your vina were too taut, was your vina in tune &amp; playable?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"...And when the strings of your vina were too loose, was your vina in tune &amp; playable?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"...And when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose, but tuned (lit: 'established') to be right on pitch, was your vina in tune &amp; playable?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>"In the same way, Sona, over-aroused persistence leads to restlessness, overly slack persistence leads to laziness. Thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence, attune ('penetrate', 'ferret out') the pitch of the [five] faculties [to that], and there pick up your theme."</p>
<p>"Yes, lord," Ven. Sona answered the Blessed One. Then, having given this exhortation to Ven. Sona, the Blessed One &mdash; as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm &mdash; disappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>
<p>So after that, Ven. Sona determined the right pitch for his persistence, attuned the pitch of the [five] faculties [to that], and there picked up his theme. Dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And thus Ven. Sona became another one of the arahants.</p>

There is the case where a monk, on seeing a form with the eye, doesn't grasp at any theme or variations by which &mdash; if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye &mdash; evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. He practices with restraint. He guards the faculty of the eye. He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye. (Similarly with the ear, nose, tongue, body, &amp; intellect.)

<p><b><a id="passage-30">&sect; 30.</a></b> "The ending of the effluents is for one who knows &amp; sees, I tell you, not for one who does not know &amp; does not see. For one who knows what &amp; sees what? Appropriate attention &amp; inappropriate attention. When a monk attends inappropriately, unarisen effluents arise, and arisen effluents increase. When a monk attends appropriately, unarisen effluents do not arise, and arisen effluents are abandoned. There are effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing, those that are to be abandoned by restraining, those that are to be abandoned by using, those that are to be abandoned by tolerating, those that are to be abandoned by avoiding, those that are to be abandoned by destroying, and those that are to be abandoned by developing.</p>
<p>"And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing? There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person... doesn't discern what ideas are fit for attention, or what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he doesn't attend to ideas fit for attention, and attends [instead] to ideas unfit for attention. And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming... the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases... This is how he attends inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?' As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view <i>I have a self</i> arises in him as true &amp; established, or the view <i>I have no self</i>... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self</i>... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self</i>... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self</i> arises in him as true &amp; established, or else he has a view like this: <i>This very self of mine &mdash; the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to the ripening of good &amp; bad actions &mdash; is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity.</i> This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, &amp; death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from stress.</p>
<p>"The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones... discerns what ideas are fit for attention, and what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he doesn't attend to ideas unfit for attention, and attends [instead] to ideas fit for attention... And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesn't arise, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of becoming... the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesn't arise, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned... He attends appropriately, <i>This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress.</i> As he attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: identity-view, doubt, and grasping at precepts &amp; practices. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing.</p>
<p>"And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by restraining? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty don't arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty. (Similarly with the ear, nose, tongue, body, &amp; intellect-faculties.) These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by restraining.</p>
<p>"And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by using? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, uses the robe simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles; simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame.</p>
<p>"Reflecting appropriately, he uses alms food, not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification; but simply for the survival &amp; continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, thinking, 'Thus will I destroy old feelings [of hunger] and not create new feelings [from overeating]. I will maintain myself, be blameless, &amp; live in comfort.'</p>
<p>"Reflecting appropriately, he uses lodging simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion.</p>
<p>"Reflecting appropriately, he uses medicinal requisites for curing illness simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease.</p>
<p>"The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things [in this way] do not arise for him when he uses them [in this way]. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by using.</p>
<p>"And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by tolerating? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, endures. He tolerates cold, heat, hunger, &amp; thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles; ill-spoken, unwelcome words &amp; bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, &amp; menacing to life. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by tolerating.</p>
<p>"And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by avoiding? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a cliff, a cesspool, an open sewer. Reflecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by avoiding.</p>
<p>"And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by destroying? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, doesn't tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, &amp; wipes it out of existence. (Similarly with thoughts of ill will, thoughts of cruelty, &amp; evil, unskillful mental qualities.) The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys them. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by destroying.</p>
<p>"And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by developing? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, develops <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>persistence</i>... <i>rapture</i>... <i>serenity</i>... <i>concentration</i>... <i>equanimity</i> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops them. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by developing.</p>
<p>"When a monk's effluents that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing, his effluents that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining, his effluents that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using, his effluents that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating, his effluents that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding, his effluents that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying, his effluents that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing, then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the effluents. He has severed craving, thrown off the fetters, and &mdash; through the right penetration of conceit &mdash; has made an end of suffering &amp; stress."</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-31">&sect; 31.</a></b> "And how is striving fruitful, how is exertion fruitful? There is the case where a monk, when not loaded down, doesn't load himself down with pain, nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma, although he is not infatuated with that pleasure. He discerns that 'When I exert a [mental] fabrication against this cause of stress, then from the fabrication of <i>exertion</i> there is dispassion (fading away). When I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress, then from the development of <i>equanimity</i> there is dispassion.' So he exerts a mental fabrication against the [first] cause of stress... and develops equanimity with regard to the [second] cause of stress... Thus the stress [coming from any cause of the first sort] is abolished... &amp; the stress [coming from any cause of the second sort] is abolished.</p>
<p>"Suppose that a man is in love with a woman, his mind ensnared with intense desire &amp; passion. He sees her standing with another man, chatting, joking, &amp; laughing. What do you think, monks: Would he... feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord..."</p>
<p>"Now suppose the thought were to occur to him, 'I am in love with this woman... When I see her standing with another man, chatting, joking, &amp; laughing, I feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. Why don't I abandon my desire &amp; passion for that woman?' So he abandons his desire &amp; passion for that woman, and afterwards sees her standing with another man, chatting, joking, &amp; laughing. What do you think, monks: Would he... feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?"</p>
<p>"No, lord..."</p>

Thus the stress [coming from any cause of the first sort] is abolished... &amp; the stress [coming from any cause of the second sort] is abolished.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the monk notices this: 'When I live according to my pleasure, unskillful mental qualities increase in me &amp; skillful qualities decline. When I exert myself with stress &amp; pain, though, unskillful qualities decline in me &amp; skillful qualities increase. Why don't I exert myself with stress &amp; pain?' So he exerts himself with stress &amp; pain, and while he is exerting himself with stress &amp; pain, unskillful qualities decline in him, &amp; skillful qualities increase. Then at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress &amp; pain. Why is that? Because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress &amp; pain...</p>
<p>"Suppose that a fletcher were to heat &amp; warm an arrow shaft between two flames, making it straight &amp; pliable. Then at a later time he would no longer heat &amp; warm the shaft between two flames, making it straight &amp; pliable. Why is that? Because he has attained the goal for which he was heating &amp; warming the shaft... In the same way, the monk... no longer exerts himself with stress &amp; pain. Why is that?

<p><b><a id="passage-39">&sect; 39.</a></b> At that time Ven. Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone. Then the Blessed One, arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to where Ven. Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone. Ven. Rahula saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, set out a seat &amp; water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and, having sat down, washed his feet. Ven. Rahula, bowing down to the Blessed One, sat to one side.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having left a little bit of water in the water dipper, said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see this little bit of left-over water remaining in the water dipper?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir."</p>
<p>"That's how little of a contemplative <i>(sama&ntilde;&ntilde;a)</i> there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie."</p>
<p>Having tossed away the little bit of left-over water, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how this little bit of left-over water is tossed away?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that."</p>
<p>Having turned the water dipper upside down, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that."</p>
<p>Having turned the water dipper right-side up, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how empty &amp; hollow this water dipper is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty &amp; hollow just like that.</p>
<p>"Rahula, it's like a royal elephant: immense, pedigreed, accustomed to battles, its tusks like chariot poles. Having gone into battle, it uses its forefeet &amp; hindfeet, its forequarters &amp; hindquarters, its head &amp; ears &amp; tusks &amp; tail, but will simply hold back its trunk. The elephant trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king.' But when the royal elephant... having gone into battle, uses its forefeet &amp; hindfeet, its forequarters &amp; hindquarters, its head &amp; ears &amp; tusks &amp; tail &amp; his trunk, the trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king. There is nothing it will not do.'</p>
<p>"The same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie: There is no evil, I tell you, he will not do. Thus, Rahula, you should train yourself, 'I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest.'"</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-40">&sect; 40.</a></b> Then, after the night had passed, the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to Prince Abhaya's home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Prince Abhaya, with his own hand, served &amp; satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple &amp; non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others?"</p>
<p>"Prince, there is no categorical yes-or-no answer to that."</p>
<p>"Then right here, lord, the Niganthas are destroyed."</p>
<p>"But prince, why do you say, 'Then right here, lord, the Niganthas are destroyed'?"</p>
<p>"Just yesterday, lord, I went to Nigantha Nataputta and... he said to me... 'Come now, prince. Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this: "Lord, would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others?" If Gotama the contemplative, thus asked, answers, "The Tathagata would say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others," then you should say, "Then how is there any difference between you, lord, and run-of-the-mill people? For even run-of-the-mill people say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others." But if Gotama the contemplative, thus asked, answers, "The Tathagata would not say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others," then you should say, "Then how, lord, did you say of Devadatta that 'Devadatta is headed for destitution, Devadatta is headed for hell, Devadatta will boil for an eon, Devadatta is incurable'? For Devadatta was upset &amp; disgruntled at those words of yours." When Gotama the contemplative is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up. Just as if a two-horned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat: he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up. In the same way, when Gotama the contemplative is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up.'"</p>
<p>Now at that time a baby boy was lying face-up on the prince's lap. So the Blessed One said to the prince, "What do you think, prince: If this young boy, through your own negligence or that of the nurse, were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth, what would you do?"</p>
<p>"I would take it out, lord. If I couldn't get it out right away, then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right, I would take it out, even if it meant drawing blood. Why is that? Because I have sympathy for the young boy."</p>
<p>"In the same way, prince:</p>
<p>[1] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial (or: not connected with the goal), unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others, he doesn't say them.</p>
<p>[2] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others, he doesn't say them.</p>
<p>[3] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, but unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them.</p>
<p>[4] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial, but endearing &amp; agreeable to others, he doesn't say them.</p>
<p>[5] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, but endearing &amp; agreeable to others, he doesn't say them.</p>
<p>[6] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, and endearing &amp; agreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. Why is that? Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings."</p>

After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "I am of the view, of the opinion, that when anyone speaks of what he has seen, [saying,] 'Thus have I seen,' there is no fault in that. When anyone speaks of what he has heard, [saying,] 'Thus have I heard,' there is no fault in that. When anyone speaks of what he has sensed, [saying,] 'Thus have I sensed,' there is no fault in that.

<p>[The Blessed One responded:] "I don't say, brahman, that everything that has been seen should be spoken about. Nor do I say that everything that has been seen should not be spoken about. [Similarly with what has been heard, sensed, or cognized.] "When, for one who speaks of what has been seen, unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decrease, then that sort of thing should not be spoken about.

As he remains thus focused on the body in &amp; of itself, a fever based on the body arises within his body, or there is sluggishness in his awareness, or his mind becomes scattered externally. He should then direct his mind to any inspiring theme [Comm: such as recollection of the Buddha]. As his mind is directed to any inspiring theme, delight arises within him. In one who feels delight, rapture arises. In one whose mind is enraptured, the body grows serene. His body serene, he feels pleasure. As he feels pleasure, his mind grows concentrated. He reflects, 'I have attained the aim to which my mind was directed. Let me withdraw [my mind from the inspiring theme].' He withdraws &amp; engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluation.

<p><b><a id="passage-46">&sect; 46.</a></b> "Now how is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination?</p>
<p>"There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>
<p>"[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' [2] Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' [3] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' [4] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'</p>
<p>"[5] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture, and to breathe out sensitive to rapture. [6] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure, and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure. [7] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental fabrications, and to breathe out sensitive to mental fabrications. [8] He trains himself to breathe in calming mental fabrication, and to breathe out calming mental fabrication.</p>
<p>"[9] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind, and to breathe out sensitive to the mind. [10] He trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind, and to breathe out satisfying the mind. [11] He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind, and to breathe out steadying the mind. [12] He trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind, and to breathe out releasing the mind.</p>
<p>"[13] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy, and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy. [14] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion <i>(literally,</i> fading), and to breathe out focusing on dispassion. [15] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation, and to breathe out focusing on cessation. [16] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment, and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment.</p>
<p>"[I] Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is breathing out long; or breathing in short, discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, discerns that he is breathing out short; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to the entire body; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out calming bodily fabrication: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this &mdash; the in-&amp;-out breath &mdash; is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
<p>"[II]On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to rapture; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to pleasure; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to mental fabrication; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out calming mental fabrication: On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>feelings</i> in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this &mdash; close attention to in-&amp;-out breaths &mdash; is classed as a feeling among feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
<p>"[III] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to the mind; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out satisfying the mind; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out steadying the mind; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out releasing the mind: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>mind</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I don't say that there is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
<p>"[IV] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on dispassion; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on cessation; trains himself to breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>mental qualities</i> in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed &amp; distress is one who oversees with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-50">&sect; 50.</a></b> "When a monk is intent on the heightened mind, there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate times. Which five?</p>
<p>"There is the case where evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; connected with desire, aversion, or delusion &mdash; arise in a monk while he is referring to &amp; attending to a particular theme. He should attend to another theme, apart from that one, connected with what is skillful. When he is attending to this other theme... those evil, unskillful thoughts... are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out, drive out, &amp; pull out a large one; in the same way... he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>
<p>"If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; connected with desire, aversion, or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme, connected with what is skillful, he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts: 'Truly, these thoughts of mine are unskillful... blameworthy... these thoughts of mine result in stress.' As he is scrutinizing their drawbacks... those evil, unskillful thoughts... are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. Just as a young woman &mdash; or man &mdash; fond of adornment, would be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck; in the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>
<p>"If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; connected with desire, aversion or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts, he should pay no mind &amp; pay no attention to those thoughts. As he is paying no mind &amp; paying no attention to them... those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. Just as a man with good eyes, not wanting to see forms that had come into range, would close his eyes or look away; in the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>
<p>"If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; connected with desire, aversion or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind &amp; paying no attention to those thoughts, he should attend to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts. As he is attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts... those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. Just as the thought would occur to a man walking quickly, 'Why am I walking quickly? Why don't I walk slowly?' So he walks slowly. The thought occurs to him, 'Why am I walking slowly? Why don't I stand?' So he stands. The thought occurs to him, 'Why am I standing? Why don't I sit down?' So he sits down. The thought occurs to him, 'Why am I sitting? Why don't I lie down?' So he lies down. In this way, giving up the grosser posture, he takes up the more refined one. In the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>
<p>"If evil, unskillful thoughts &mdash; connected with desire, aversion or delusion &mdash; still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts, then &mdash; with his teeth clenched &amp; his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth &mdash; he should beat down, constrain, &amp; crush his mind with his awareness. As &mdash; with his teeth clenched &amp; his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth &mdash; he is beating down, constraining, &amp; crushing his mind with his awareness... those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned &amp; subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it. Just as a strong man, seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders, would beat him down, constrain, &amp; crush him; in the same way... the monk steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it.</p>
<p>"Now when a monk... attending to another theme... scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts... paying no mind &amp; paying no attention to those thoughts... attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts... beating down, constraining &amp; crushing his mind with his awareness... steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, &amp; concentrates it: He is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequences. He thinks whatever thought he wants to, and doesn't think whatever thought he doesn't. He has severed craving, thrown off the fetters, and &mdash; through the right penetration of conceit &mdash; has made an end of suffering &amp; stress."</p>

<p>"And what is the development of concentration that... leads to the attainment of knowledge &amp; vision?

<p>"And what is the development of concentration that... leads to mindfulness &amp; alertness? There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.

<p><b><a id="passage-53">&sect; 53.</a></b> Now what, monks, is five-factored noble right concentration? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal.</p>
<p>Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again &amp; again with water, so that his ball of bath powder &mdash; saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within &amp; without &mdash; would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal. This is the first development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure.</p>
<p>Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from east, west, north, or south, and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate &amp; pervade, suffuse &amp; fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. This is the second development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>
<p>And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture.</p>
<p>Just as in a blue-, white-, or red-lotus pond, there may be some of the blue, white, or red lotuses which, born &amp; growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated &amp; pervaded, suffused &amp; filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those blue, white, or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. This is the third development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>
<p>And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; stress &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness.</p>
<p>Just as if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating his body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness. This is the fourth development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>
<p>And furthermore, the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand, well attended to, well considered, well tuned (well penetrated) by means of discernment.</p>
<p>Just as if one person were to reflect on another, or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person, or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down; even so, monks, the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand, well attended to, well pondered, well tuned by means of discernment. This is the fifth development of the five-factored noble right concentration.</p>
<p>When a monk has developed &amp; pursued the five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know &amp; realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>
<p>Imagine a water jar, set on a stand, brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it. If a strong man were to tip it in any way at all, would water spill out?</p>
<p>Yes, lord.</p>
<p>In the same way, when a monk has developed &amp; pursued the five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know &amp; realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>
<p>Imagine a rectangular water tank &mdash; set on level ground, bounded by dikes &mdash; brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it. If a strong man were to loosen the dikes anywhere at all, would water spill out?</p>
<p>Yes, lord...</p>
<p>Imagine a chariot on level ground at four crossroads, harnessed to thoroughbreds, waiting with whips lying ready, so that a skilled driver, a trainer of tamable horses, might mount and &mdash; taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right &mdash; drive out &amp; back, to whatever place and by whichever road he liked; in the same way, when a monk has developed &amp; pursued the five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know &amp; realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>

<p>Ananda: It wasn't the case that the Blessed One praised all sorts of jhana, nor did he criticize all sorts of jhana. And what sort of jhana didn't he praise? There is the case where a certain person dwells with his awareness overcome by sensual passion, obsessed with sensual passion. He doesn't discern the escape, as it actually is present, from sensual passion once it has arisen. Making that sensual passion the focal point, he absorbs himself with it, besorbs, resorbs, &amp; supersorbs himself with it.</p>

<p>"And what is the right resolve that has effluents, sides with merit, &amp; results in acquisitions? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness. This is the right resolve that has effluents, sides with merit, &amp; results in acquisitions.</p>
<p>"And what is the right resolve that is without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The thinking, directed thinking, resolve, mental absorption, mental fixity, focused awareness, &amp; verbal fabrications in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. This is the right resolve that is without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.</p>
<p>"One tries to abandon wrong resolve &amp; to enter into right resolve: This is one's right effort. One is mindful to abandon wrong resolve &amp; to enter &amp; remain in right resolve: This is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three qualities &mdash; right view, right effort, &amp; right mindfulness &mdash; run &amp; circle around right resolve."</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-63">&sect; 63.</a></b> "'Stress should be known. The cause by which stress comes into play should be known. The diversity in stress should be known. The result of stress should be known. The cessation of stress should be known. The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known.' Thus it has been said. Why was it said?</p>
<p>"Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stressful; association with what is not loved is stressful, separation from what is loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five aggregates for sustenance are stressful.</p>
<p>"And what is the cause by which stress comes into play? Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play.</p>
<p>"And what is the diversity in stress? There is major stress &amp; minor, slowly fading &amp; quickly fading. This is called the diversity in stress.</p>
<p>"And what is the result of stress? There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, &amp; becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?' I tell you, monks, that stress results either in bewilderment or in search.</p>
<p>"And what is the cessation of stress? From the cessation of craving is the cessation of stress; and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "non-existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one.

<p>'By &amp; large, Kaccayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings (sustenances), &amp; biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or latent tendencies; nor is he resolved on "my self." He has no uncertainty or doubt that, when there is arising, only stress is arising; and that when there is passing away, stress is passing away. In this, one's knowledge is independent of others.

<p><b><a id="passage-65">&sect; 65.</a></b> Then Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were staying. On arrival he greeted them courteously. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the wanderers said to him, 'Tell us, householder, what views Gotama the contemplative has.'</p>
<p>'Venerable sirs, I don't know entirely what views the Blessed One has.'</p>
<p>'Well, well. So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has. Then tell us what views the monks have.'</p>
<p>'I don't even know entirely what views the monks have.'</p>
<p>'So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks have. Then tell us what views you have.'</p>
<p>'It wouldn't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have. But please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position, and then it won't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have.'</p>
<p>When this had been said, one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder, <i>'The cosmos is eternal.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have.'</p>
<p>Another wanderer said to Anathapindika, <i>'The cosmos is not eternal.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have.'</p>
<p>Another wanderer said, <i>'The cosmos is finite...' ...'The cosmos is infinite...' ...'The soul &amp; the body are the same...' ...'The soul is one thing and the body another...' ...'After death a Tathagata exists...' ...'After death a Tathagata does not exist...' ...'After death a Tathagata both does &amp; does not exist...' ...'After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have.'</p>
<p>When this had been said, Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers, 'As for the venerable one who says, <i>"The cosmos is eternal.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have," his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another. Now this view has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen. Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress, submits himself to that very stress.' (Similarly for the other positions.)</p>
<p>When this had been said, the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder, 'We have each &amp; every one expounded to you in line with our own positions. Now tell us what views you have.'</p>
<p>'Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not mine, is not what I am, is not my self. This is the sort of view I have.'</p>
<p>'So, householder, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. You thus adhere to that very stress, submit yourself to that very stress.'</p>
<p>'Venerable sirs, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not mine, is not what I am, is not my self.

<p>When this had been said, the wanderers fell silent, abashed, sitting with their shoulders drooping, their heads down, brooding, at a loss for words. Anathapindika the householder, perceiving that the wanderers were silent, abashed... at a loss for words, got up &amp; left.</p>

As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "When a monk is an arahant, with his fermentations ended, one who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is released through right gnosis, he is dedicated to six things: renunciation, seclusion, non-afflictiveness, the ending of craving, the ending of clinging/sustenance, &amp; non-deludedness.</p>
<p>"Now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think, 'Perhaps it is entirely dependent on conviction that this venerable one is dedicated to renunciation,' but it should not be seen in that way. The monk whose fermentations are ended, having fulfilled [the holy life], does not see in himself anything further to do, or anything further to add to what he has done. It is because of the ending of passion, because of his being free of passion, that he is dedicated to renunciation. It is because of the ending of aversion, because of his being free of aversion, that he is dedicated to renunciation. It is because of the ending of delusion, because of his being free of delusion, that he is dedicated to renunciation.</p>
<p>"Now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think, 'Perhaps it is because he desires gain, honor, &amp; fame that this venerable one is dedicated to seclusion'... 'Perhaps it is because he falls back on attachment to precepts &amp; practices as being essential that he is dedicated to non-afflictiveness,' but it should not be seen in that way. The monk whose fermentations are ended, having fulfilled [the holy life], does not see in himself anything further to do, or anything further to add to what he has done. It is because of the ending of passion, because of his being free of passion, that he is dedicated to non-afflictiveness. It is because of the ending of aversion, because of his being free of aversion, that he is dedicated to non-afflictiveness. It is because of the ending of delusion, because of his being free of delusion, that he is dedicated to non-afflictiveness.</p>
<p>"It is because of the ending of passion, because of his being free of passion... because of the ending of aversion, because of his being free of aversion... because of the ending of delusion, because of his being free of delusion, that he is dedicated to the ending of craving... to the ending of clinging/sustenance... to non-deludedness.</p>
<p>"Even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released, his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged. Being still, having reached imperturbability, he focuses on their passing away. And even if powerful sounds... aromas... flavors... tactile sensations... Even if powerful ideas cognizable by the intellect come into the mental range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released, his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged. Being still, having reached imperturbability, he focuses on their passing away.</p>
<p>"Just as if there were a mountain of rock &mdash; without cracks, without fissures, one solid mass &mdash; and then from the east there were to come a powerful storm of wind &amp; rain: the mountain would neither shiver nor quiver nor shake. And then from the west... the north... the south there were to come a powerful storm of wind &amp; rain: the mountain would neither shiver nor quiver nor shake.

	the mind is rightly released.
For that monk, rightly released,
	his heart at peace,
	there's nothing to be done,
	   nothing to add
	   to what's done.
As a single mass of rock isn't moved by the wind,
even so all	 forms, flavors, sounds,
	   aromas, contacts,
	   ideas desirable &amp; not,
	have no effect on one who is Such.
	   The mind
 &mdash; still, totally released &mdash;
	   focuses on
their passing away.

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-75">&sect; 75.</a></b> "Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen &mdash; clear, limpid, and unsullied &mdash; where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, and unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental effluents. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental effluents... This is the origination of effluents... This is the cessation of effluents... This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, the effluent of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-76">&sect; 76.</a></b> "Vision arose, clear knowing arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before: 'This is the noble truth of stress...

<div class="excerpt">
<p><b><a id="passage-77">&sect; 77.</a></b> "What a Tathagata sees is this: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is feeling, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is perception...such are mental fabrications...such is consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.' Because of this, I say, a Tathagata &mdash; with the ending, fading out, cessation, renunciation, &amp; relinquishment of all construings, all excogitations, all I-making &amp; mine-making &amp; obsessions with conceit &mdash; is, through lack of clinging/sustenance, released."</p>
<p>"But, Master Gotama, the monk whose mind is thus released: Where does he reappear?"</p>
<p>"'Reappear,' Vaccha, doesn't apply."</p>
<p>"In that case, Master Gotama, he does not reappear."</p>
<p>"'Does not reappear,' Vaccha, doesn't apply."</p>
<p>"...both does &amp; does not reappear."</p>
<p>"...doesn't apply."</p>
<p>"...neither does nor does not reappear."</p>
<p>"...doesn't apply."</p>
<p>"How is it, Master Gotama, when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears... does not reappear... both does &amp; does not reappear... neither does nor does not reappear, he says, '... doesn't apply' in each case. At this point, Master Gotama, I am befuddled; at this point, confused. The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured."</p>
<p>"Of course you're befuddled, Vaccha. Of course you're confused. Deep, Vaccha, is this phenomenon, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. For those with other views, other practices, other satisfactions, other aims, other teachers, it is difficult to know. That being the case, I will now put some questions to you. Answer as you see fit. How do you construe this, Vaccha: If a fire were burning in front of you, would you know that, 'This fire is burning in front of me'?"</p>
<p>"...yes..."</p>
<p>"And suppose someone were to ask you, Vaccha, 'This fire burning in front of you, dependent on what is it burning?' Thus asked, how would you reply?"</p>
<p>"...I would reply, 'This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass &amp; timber as its sustenance.'"</p>
<p>"If the fire burning in front of you were to go out, would you know that, 'This fire burning in front of me has gone out'?"</p>
<p>"...yes..."</p>
<p>"And suppose someone were to ask you, 'This fire that has gone out in front of you, in which direction from here has it gone? East? West? North? Or south?' Thus asked, how would you reply?"</p>
<p>"That doesn't apply, Master Gotama. Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass &amp; timber, being unnourished &mdash; from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other &mdash; is classified simply as 'out' (unbound)."</p>
<p>"Even so, Vaccha, any physical form by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him: That the Tathagata has abandoned, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. Freed from the classification of form, Vaccha, the Tathagata is deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea. 'Reappears' doesn't apply. 'Does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Both does &amp; does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply.</p>
<p>"Any feeling... Any perception... Any mental fabrication...</p>
<p>"Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him: That the Tathagata has abandoned, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. Freed from the classification of consciousness, Vaccha, the Tathagata is deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea."</p>
