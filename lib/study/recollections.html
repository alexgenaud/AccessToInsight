<h1><a id='intro'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>Meditation is not simply a matter of bare attention. It is more a matter of <i>appropriate</i> attention, seeing experience in terms of the four noble truths and responding in line with the tasks appropriate to those truths: stress is to be comprehended, its cause abandoned, its cessation realized, and the path to its cessation developed. These tasks involve processes of thought, analysis, and memory &mdash; which means that these processes, instead of being enemies of meditation, are actually the means by which Awakening is attained.</p>

<p>The ten recollections are a set of meditation themes that highlight the positive role that memory and thought play in training the mind. They employ memory to sensitize the mind to the need for training, to induce feelings of confidence and well-being conducive for concentration, to keep the topics of concentration in mind, to produce tranquility and insight, and to incline the mind toward the deathless when tranquility and insight have grown sufficiently strong.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, only seven of the ten are actually "recollections" <i>(anussati):</i> recollection of the Buddha, recollection of the Dhamma, recollection of the Sangha, recollection of virtue, recollection of generosity, recollection of the devas, and recollection of stilling. The other three are called mindfulness <i>(sati)</i> practices: mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, mindfulness of death, and mindfulness immersed in the body. However, the Pali words for mindfulness and recollection &mdash; <i>sati</i> and <i>anussati</i> &mdash; are intimately related. In the Pali Canon, <i>sati</i> does not simply mean awareness. It means the ability to keep something in mind; it is a function of the active memory. This point is clear in the Buddha's definition of the faculty of mindfulness (<a href="#passage_11">&sect;11</a>), and it crops up again and again in the descriptions of these three mindfulness practices: mindfulness involves keeping particular themes or intentions in mind so as to induce mental states necessary for concentration, clear insight, and release. Thus all ten of these practices &mdash; the recollections and mindfulness practices &mdash; employ memory as an essential factor. For convenience's sake, it seems best to stick to the traditional label of "recollection" for all ten.</p>

<p>Unlike other sets of meditation practices, such as the four frames of reference <i>(satipatthana)</i> or the four sublime abidings <i>(brahmavihara),</i> the ten recollections do not have a single canonical discourse devoted to the entire set. Thus the way they interact and support one another has to be pieced together from many different discourses scattered throughout the Canon. The only place where they are listed as a set is in a series of ten short discourses in the Anguttara Nikaya (<a href="#passage_1">&sect;&sect;1-10</a>). These discourses suggest that all ten recollections function in the same way, for all are described in the same terms: "This is one thing that &mdash; when developed &amp; pursued &mdash; leads solely to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding." From this formulaic statement, it might be concluded that all ten are equivalent and interchangeable, and that the choice of one theme over the others is simply a matter of personal preference. However, other passages in the Canon indicate that this is not so. Each recollection plays a specific role in the practice, and all are needed to provide a complete and effective training for the mind. In this way, they are like the contents of a meditator's toolbox: a range of approaches that every meditator should master so as to respond skillfully to whatever issue arises in the practice.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the roles of these practices are these:</p>

<p>1) Mindfulness of death is meant to evoke a sense of <i>samvega</i> &mdash; a sense of dismay over the dangers and futility of human life as it is normally lived, with its ordinary defilements, and a sense of urgency in trying to find a way beyond those limitations. This sense of urgency further induces the quality of heedfulness in approaching the practice, which the Buddha said is basic to all skillful endeavors.</p>

<p>2) The first six recollections &mdash; of the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, virtue, generosity, and the devas &mdash; are meant to induce a sense of joy and confidence <i>(pasada)</i> in the practice. The first two induce a sense of confidence in the practice itself; the last three, a sense of confidence in one's own worthiness to follow the practice; while the third theme &mdash; recollection of the Sangha &mdash; can induce both. The texts say that the joy and confidence induced by these practices can bring the mind to concentration and cleanse it of defilement, although they do not describe in any detail as to how far this cleansing goes or how it occurs. Passage <a href="#passage_16">&sect;16</a>, however, suggests that these themes can perform this function as adjuncts to mindfulness practice.</p>

<p>3) Mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and mindfulness immersed in the body are the primary themes for developing tranquility and insight so as to lead to strong concentration in terms of the four jhanas, or absorptions; and they develop jhana in such a way that it gives added power to tranquility and insight in leading the mind to release (<a href="#passage_36">&sect;36</a>).</p>

<p>Of all the meditation themes taught in the Canon, mindfulness of in-and-out breathing is treated in the most detail, and so it seems to have pride of place among the ten recollections. The Buddha himself, prior to his Awakening, apparently practiced this theme more than any other (<a href="#passage_32">&sect;32</a>). After his Awakening, he frequently continued to practice it as well (<a href="#passage_40">&sect;40</a>). However, mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and mindfulness immersed in the body play complementary roles on the path. To begin with, there is some overlap in the two, in that the first four steps of breath meditation are also listed as techniques in mindfulness immersed in the body. In addition, mindfulness immersed in the body &mdash; especially in its aspect as contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body &mdash; can handle strong defilements that in some cases do not respond to the tranquil concentration induced by mindfulness of in-and-out breathing (<a href="#passage_53">&sect;53</a>). At the same time, mindfulness immersed in the body can sometimes induce strong feelings of disgust and revulsion that cause the mind to respond in unskillful ways. When this happens, mindfulness of in-and-out breathing can help dispel those feelings and replace them with a feeling of refreshment that helps the mind stay skillfully on the path (<a href="#passage_33">&sect;33</a>). In this way, these two mindfulness practices work together to keep the mind balanced and on course.</p>

<p>4) Once the mind has been brought to a developed state of tranquility and insight &mdash; able to see even the pleasures of jhana as inconstant, stressful, and not-self &mdash; recollection of stilling is brought to bear so that the mind does not simply stay focused on the drawbacks of fabricated experiences. It does this by inclining the mind to the exquisite peace of the deathless, experienced through dispassion, cessation, and Unbinding (<a href="#passage_57">&sect;57</a>).</p>

<p>When viewed in this way &mdash; starting with mindfulness of death and ending with a recollection aimed at Unbinding &mdash; the ten recollections illustrate the principle stated in <a href="#passage_42">&sect;&sect;42-43</a>, that mindfulness of death has, as its final end, not death but the deathless.</p>

<p>The seven sections of this study guide are designed to flesh out this general outline. The material in each section is drawn from the Pali Canon and has been selected to provide more specifics as to the <i>how,</i> the <i>what,</i> and the <i>why</i> of each of these practices: how they function, what is supposed to be recollected in each of these themes, and why each recollection is useful in training the mind. In reading these sections, the following overview is useful to keep in mind:</p>

<p><b>Section One.</b> This section contains the only section of the Canon where the ten recollections are presented as a list. It also contains the Buddha's definition of the faculty of mindfulness, to show that "mindfulness" in his vocabulary means something similar to "recollection."</p>

<p><b>Section Two.</b> This section covers the first six recollections as a set. Passages <a href="#passage_12">&sect;&sect;12-13</a> describe exactly what is to be recollected in these practices. <a href="#passage_12">&sect;12</a> deals both with the qualities of mind that should be brought to these recollections &mdash; the five strengths of conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment &mdash; and the rewards of these recollections in terms of joy and increased concentration. <a href="#passage_13">&sect;13</a> emphasizes that this increased joy and concentration can also lead to cleansing the mind of defilements; it also stresses that these recollections are a useful part of any uposatha practice: the practice by which lay people rest from their daily work on the full moon, new moon, and quarter moon days, devoting those days to listening to the Dhamma and training the mind in meditation. Passages <a href="#passage_14">&sect;&sect;14-16</a> indicate two other uses for this joy and concentration: cleansing the mind of fear and other unskillful thoughts while dwelling in seclusion, and relieving the mind and body of any feverish or unsettling feelings that would prevent mindfulness practice from yielding higher states of jhana.</p>

<p><b>Section Three.</b> This section contains passages that aid in the recollection of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, adding more detail to the standard passages for each of these recollections. Because these recollections are meant to be inspiring, it is helpful to know in more detail some of the inspiring attributes of their objects. Yet, because different people will find different aspects of these objects more or less inspiring at any particular time, this section cannot begin to cover the full range of passages that might be helpful in offering inspiration. Instead, they focus more on the basics. In the case of the Buddha, this means focusing on his Awakening and the way he found it (<a href="#passage_17">&sect;17</a>). In the case of the Dhamma, this means focusing on the qualities of mind the practice of the Dhamma is meant to induce (<a href="#passage_18">&sect;18</a>) and on the manner in which the Dhamma is taught (<a href="#passage_19">&sect;&sect;19-22</a>). In the case of the Sangha, this means focusing on how the Buddha's noble disciples were able to overcome inner and outer obstacles in the path. This last set of passages focuses on what honorable and admirable people they became, thus inspiring confidence in them. But it also focuses on the fact that they began their practice with weaknesses similar to &mdash; or even worse than &mdash; ours, and yet they were able to overcome those weaknesses using personal qualities that we all have in potential form. This latter consideration helps to inspire confidence in our own ability to follow the path as well.</p>

<p><b>Section Four.</b> This section covers the practice of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing. It includes passages that discuss the conditions that enable this practice to give quick results (<a href="#passage_29">&sect;29</a>), and passages that go into detail as to how rewarding those results can be (&sect;&sect;<a href="#passage_30">30</a>, <a href="#passage_32">32</a>, <a href="#passage_33">33</a>, <a href="#passage_40">40</a>). Central to this section are the repeated references to the sixteen steps that comprise the Buddha's approach to mindfulness of in-and-out breathing:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' [2] Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' [3] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.'

[16] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.'"</p>
</div>

<p>These sixteen steps show that the Buddha did not regard this practice simply as a preliminary to other, more advanced practices. These steps cover the entire path leading to full release. As <a href="#passage_31">&sect;31</a> shows in its presentation of these steps, mindfulness of breathing does not simply mean staying with the breath in the present; it involves training the mind to develop a range of skills with each in and out breath.</p>

<p>The irony of these sixteen steps is that even though they are the Buddha's most detailed meditation instructions, the Canon leaves unanswered a number of important questions concerning them. The most prominent question concerns how the sixteen steps are related to one another. Are they meant to be sequential, or can they be developed in a non-sequential way? Should the meditator try to cover all sixteen, or is it enough to focus on just one of the four tetrads making up the sixteen? And in either case, how is this done?</p>

<p>Different passages suggest different answers to these questions. The suttas that present the sixteen steps without further explanation seem to indicate that all sixteen steps are to be followed, and in a sequential way. Passage <a href="#passage_30">&sect;30</a>, however, equates each of the tetrads with a frame of reference, and then goes on to state that each frame of reference is sufficient to fulfill the seven factors for Awakening, which in turn lead to full release. This suggests that it's enough to focus on any one of the tetrads. But in either case, the suttas don't explain how one step leads to another. Perhaps this lack of explanation was an intentional part of the Buddha's teaching style, forcing his students to make discoveries on their own. But it can be helpful to share a few thoughts on the matter based on what the suttas, taken together, seem to suggest.</p>

<p><a href="#passage_49">&sect;49</a> indicates that the steps are meant, among other things, to lead to the jhanas. Thus the practice of the sixteen steps, in one way or another, should relate to the practice of jhana. And there are at least two possible ways in which this can happen: one based on following the path of all sixteen steps, and the other based on following the path of one of the tetrads.</p>

<p>First, taking the path of all sixteen steps:</p>

<p>Steps 1 and 2 involve two of the factors of the first jhana, directed thought and evaluation: directing one's thoughts and attention to the breath in and of itself in the present, at the same time evaluating it as one begins to discern variations in the length of the breath. Some modern teachers maintain that the factor of evaluation here also includes taking one's observations of short and long breathing as a basis for adjusting the rhythm of the breath to make it as comfortable as possible. Because the first level of jhana must be based on a sense of pleasure, this advice is very practical.</p>

<p>The remaining steps are willed or determined: one "trains oneself," first by manipulating one's sense of conscious awareness, making it sensitive to the body as a whole (step 3). Then one can begin manipulating the bodily sensations that become apparent within that full-body awareness, reducing them to a single sensation of calm by letting "bodily fabrication" &mdash; the in and out breathing &mdash; grow calm (step 4). As the breathing grows calm, it allows for easeful sensations of rapture and pleasure to grow prominent. A comparison between the stages of breath meditation and the similes for the jhanas (<a href="#passage_49">&sect;49</a>) suggests that steps 5 and 6 &mdash; being sensitive to rapture and pleasure &mdash; involve making these feelings "single" as well, by letting them suffuse the entire body, just as the bathman kneads the moisture throughout his ball of bath powder. With bodily fabrications stilled, mental fabrications &mdash; feelings and perceptions &mdash; become clearly apparent as they occur (step 7), just as tuning a radio precisely to a certain frequency eliminates static and allows the message sent by the radio station broadcasting at that frequency to become clear. These mental fabrications, too, are calmed (step 8), a step symbolized in the similes for the jhanas by the still waters in the simile for the third jhana, in contrast to the spring waters welling up in the second. What remains is simply a sense of the mind itself (step 9), corresponding to the level of fourth jhana, in which the body is filled from head to toe with a single sense of bright, radiant awareness.</p>

<p>Once this stage is reached, one can now turn one's attention to consolidating one's mastery of concentration. This is done by reviewing the various levels of jhana, focusing not so much on the breath as on the mind as it relates to the breath. This develops a sensitivity to the different ways in which the mind can be brought to the desired state for gaining greater tranquility or insight. For instance, if it needs to be gladdened (step 10), one can gladden it with refreshing breathing or with any of the inspiring recollections (see <a href="#passage_16">&sect;16</a>). If it needs to be steadied (step 11), one can develop  full-body awareness and calm any disturbances that can be detected in terms of bodily or mental fabrication. In the process of mastering these skills, one also begins to grow sensitive to the different factors from which the mind can be released (step 12) as it goes through the different levels of jhana &mdash; for example, releasing it from sensuality by taking it to the first jhana, releasing it from directed thought and evaluation by taking it from the first jhana to the second, releasing it from rapture by taking it from the second level to the third, and so forth (<a href="#passage_38">&sect;&sect;38-39</a>). One comes to see that, although the breath feels different on the different levels of jhana, the cause is not so much the breath as it is the way the mind relates to the breath, shedding the various mental activities surrounding its single preoccupation.</p>

<p>The mastery of concentration developed in steps 9-12 provides an excellent chance to develop discernment into the pattern of cause and effect in the process of concentrating the mind, in that one must master the causal factors before gaining the desired results in terms of gladness, steadiness, and release. This insight into cause and effect provides the basis for insight, the ability to see events in the mind simply as events, arising and passing away as part of a chain of causes and effects that also arise and pass away.</p>

<p>Realizing the inconstancy and unreliability of the events in this pattern (step 13) gives rise to the realization that they are also stressful and not-self: neither "me" nor "mine," but simply instances of the first noble truth of suffering and stress. When this discernment goes straight to the heart, there occurs a sense of dispassion for any craving directed at them (step 14, which corresponds to the duty of abandoning the second noble truth) and an experience of their fading away and cessation (step 15, the third noble truth). Finally, one relinquishes attachment not only to these events (step 16), but also to the discernment that sees through to their true nature (thus abandoning the fourth noble truth that, now that it has been fully developed, has completed its tasks). This brings the seven factors for Awakening to completion in a state "dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go," where "letting go" would appear to be equivalent to the "relinquishment" in step 16. When one is able simply to experience the act of relinquishment, without feeling that one is "doing" the relinquishing, one stands at the threshold to total release.</p>

<p>In this interpretation of the sixteen steps, the first two tetrads constitute the stage of familiarizing oneself with the potentials of concentration that can be attained by focusing on the breath, the third tetrad constitutes the stage of gaining insight to the patterns of cause and effect through mastering the concentration, and the fourth tetrad constitutes the stage of bringing the mind to a point of relinquishing all activity, even the activity of the path. These three stages correspond to the three stages of frames-of-reference practice described in detail in <i>The Wings to Awakening.</i></p>

<p>As for the interpretation in which each of the four tetrads is regarded as sufficient for full release, this is best understood by first looking at the underlying pattern of the seven factors for Awakening, which each tetrad is said to fulfill. The seven factors begin with mindfulness established on a particular frame of reference: the body in and of itself, feelings in and of themselves, the mind in and of itself, or mental qualities in and of themselves. This is followed by analysis of qualities <i>(dhammas),</i> which not only perceives the chosen frame of reference in terms of dhammas, but also how these dhammas may be skillful or unskillful (<a href="#passage_35">&sect;35</a>). Then follows persistence, which &mdash; as right effort &mdash; abandons the unskillful qualities and develops the skillful ones, leading to the factors of rapture, calm, concentration, and equanimity. Thus the general pattern consists of (1) focusing on a particular frame of reference, (2) seeing it as dhammas, and (3) dealing with those dhammas in a skillful way so as to bring about calming and peace.</p>

<p>This is precisely the pattern followed in each of the four tetrads. As one stays focused on the breath as one's basic theme to the point of giving rise to jhana, one has the choice of viewing the events of the developing concentration in terms of any one of the four frames of reference: the body (corresponding to the first tetrad), feelings (corresponding to the second), the mind (corresponding to the third), and mental qualities (corresponding to the fourth). As long as one's practice is skillful, events will develop in line with the above pattern regardless of the chosen frame. Thus each tetrad provides a particular perspective on these events, as they relate to the corresponding frame of reference.</p>

<p>The first tetrad shows how the development of breath concentration registers in terms of the body. In steps 1 and 2, one becomes sensitized to the breath in terms of its length. In step 3, one becomes sensitive to the breath as a whole-body process (this corresponds to the full-body awareness described in the similes for the jhanas). In step 4, this full-body awareness enables one to see the breath as a process fabricating the experience of the body. This in turn inclines one to allow that fabrication to grow calm (step 4), creating feelings of rapture, pleasure, and ultimately, equanimity. According to <a href="#passage_38">&sect;38</a>, this can lead &mdash; in the fourth jhana &mdash; to the absolute stilling of the in-and-out breath, as the oxygen needs of the body decrease when the mind reaches a firm stillness.</p>

<p>The second tetrad shows how the development of breath concentration registers in terms of feelings. In steps 5 and 6, one becomes sensitive to feelings of rapture and pleasure as they begin to manifest in the course of developing concentration: first in a gentle way, then in stronger ways. In step 7, this sensitivity allows one to see the impact that these feelings have in fabricating the mind, together with the perceptions (mental labels) that allow for one to maximize this sensitivity and its impact in the first place. This in turn inclines one to allow these feelings and perceptions to grow calm (step 8). An example of calming feeling would be abandoning rapture for equanimity. An example of calming perception would be to perceive the body as a full energy field, rather than as a solid mass, thus making it easier for the in-and-out breathing to grow still. According to <a href="#passage_38">&sect;38</a>, this step-by-step process of calming can lead through the jhanas and into the formless states, culminating in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

<p>The third tetrad charts the development of breath concentration in terms of the mind. In step 9, one simply becomes sensitive to the state of the mind's awareness as it focuses on the breath in the present moment. In response to that sensitivity, one can use the breath to induce desired states in the mind. If the mind needs gladdening (step 10), one can breathe in ways that induce rapture and pleasure. (If this can't be accomplished with the breath, <a href="#passage_16">&sect;16</a> suggests using any of the recollections that will produce the desired effect.) If the mind needs steadying (step 11), one can bring it to strong states of jhana by developing a strong, full-body awareness, and by allowing both bodily fabrication and mental fabrication to grow calm. As concentration develops, one can release the mind (step 12) from the affliction of sensuality by bringing it into jhana, and from the "afflictions" of the lower jhanas (<a href="#passage_38">&sect;&sect;38-39</a>) by bringing it to the higher jhanas. This process of release, if it involves only the jhanas, is temporary, but if it leads to the release of Unbinding, it is total and permanent.</p>

<p>The fourth tetrad describes the development of breath concentration in terms of mental qualities (dhammas). To be sensitive to mental qualities, one first has to be sensitive to their arising and passing away. Thus the first step is to look for their inconstancy (step 13), to see when they arise, <i>how</i> they arise; when they pass away, <i>how</i> they pass away. As one is developing concentration based on the breath, one has to watch both for the inconstancy of the unskillful qualities that block concentration &mdash; the hindrances &mdash; and for the skillful qualities that nurture it: the factors for Awakening (<a href="#passage_34">&sect;34</a>). In seeing the hindrances simply as events, one can pull away from them, weigh their allure and drawbacks, and develop dispassion for them (step 14). Because one feels dispassionate toward them, one no longer participates in fabricating them. Thus they cease (step 15). On this preliminary level, however, the cessation is temporary, and lasts only as long as concentration can be maintained.</p>

<p>However, the practice of dealing with the hindrances in this way strengthens the first three factors for Awakening: mindfulness, analysis of qualities, and persistence. In watching these factors as events, one focuses on their inconstancy with a different agenda in mind: instead of trying to develop dispassion for them immediately, one tries to understand the causal factors behind their arising and passing away so that the factors for Awakening can be brought into being more often and maintained for longer periods of time (<a href="#passage_34">&sect;34</a>). This process, combined with the continued absence of the hindrances, allows one's concentration to grow stronger and more solid.</p>

<p>As one attains the higher jhanas, one is in a position to change tactics. One can now view the lower jhanas in terms of their inconstancy so as to induce dispassion for them, too (step 14). This tactic can be applied to higher and higher levels of jhana as one's powers of concentration and insight advance. Here again, the sense of dispassion at first leads only to temporary cessation (step 15). But as this process continues, there come stages of realization in which various hindrances and fetters are totally relinquished once and for all (step 16), yielding the ultimate in calm and release.</p>

<p>Thus in this interpretation, each of the four tetrads of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing charts the way in which meditation progresses as seen from a particular point of view. They all touch on the same process &mdash; with the same three-step dynamic of (1) sensitizing, (2) viewing as dhammas, and then (3) calming &mdash; showing how this process appears simultaneously from different frames of reference. In the course of one's practice, one is likely to shift among all four of these frames of reference, for they are all interrelated. For example, in gladdening the mind, one focuses on the breath to calm bodily fabrication, and on feelings of rapture and pleasure as means of inducing gladness. In becoming sensitive to the entire body, one naturally notices mental qualities that interfere with whole-body awareness, and mental qualities that nurture it. However, as the practice develops, individual meditators will tend to focus on one frame more than the others. The four tetrads show how, regardless of the chosen frame, all four frames can simultaneously be brought into line with the basic pattern of the seven factors for Awakening.</p>

<p>Regardless of which of these two interpretations one follows &mdash; and it is possible in practice to follow both &mdash; mindfulness of in-and-out breathing is obviously a method in which tranquility and insight develop in tandem. As <a href="#passage_37">&sect;37</a> shows, tranquility is a matter of allowing the mind to settle and become unified; insight, a matter of regarding experience in terms of fabrications. In the Buddha's practice of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, the mind is brought to stillness and unity through watching the breath &mdash; and its attendant feelings and mind-states &mdash; in terms of fabrication, and allowing those fabrications to grow calm. Calm is thus attained through insight, insight through calm. Perhaps it was because this method progresses in such a balanced way that the Buddha used it as his preferred theme of meditation, and taught it more frequently and in more detail than any other.</p>

<p><b>Section Five.</b> This section covers mindfulness of death. As the passages collected here show, the Buddha taught this topic not to induce a feeling of depression or hopelessness, or a sense of sentimental nostalgia for the beauties of the world. He taught it to encourage heedfulness, a sense that a great deal needs to be done in training the mind, and that not much time remains to do it. Thus mindfulness of death fosters an appreciation of what human life offers the opportunity to <i>do.</i> What is valuable about life is not the pleasures that can be experienced, but the skillful mental qualities that can be developed. Death is not the end, but a transition, and the transition will be easy or difficult depending on the qualities one has built into one's mind. Because there is no way of knowing when death will come, one should focus each day on which skillful qualities of mind most need developing, and which unskillful ones most need abandoning. Mindfulness of death is thus an excellent practice for ordering one's priorities. As <a href="#passage_42">&sect;&sect;42-45</a> point out, today may be one's last day in this life. What remains to be done? Some ideas are offered by <a href="#passage_46">&sect;46</a>, which point out the mental traits that lead one to fear death, and <a href="#passage_47">&sect;&sect;47-48</a>, which point out the traits by which death leads to rebirth. If one focuses on lessening and eradicating these traits, one's mindfulness of death can actually lead to the deathless.</p>

<p><b>Section Six.</b> This section covers mindfulness immersed in the body. Passage <a href="#passage_47">&sect;47</a>, in discussing how the body is a theme for both mindfulness practice and jhana practice, illustrates a consistent theme in the suttas: that there is no sharp divide between mindfulness and concentration practices, and that mindfulness is intended to lead to jhana. It also contains the most complete discussion of the methods of this practice, along with its rewards. In addition to the benefits listed in this sutta, however, other passages list other benefits as well: mindfulness immersed in the body helps in overcoming lust (<a href="#passage_51">&sect;51</a>), pride based one's appearance or race (<a href="#passage_50">&sect;50</a>), and fear of death (<a href="#passage_46">&sect;46</a>). It also provides a solid basis for restraint of the senses (<a href="#passage_42">&sect;&sect;42-43</a>). Passage <a href="#passage_33">&sect;33</a> points out that one of the practices listed under this heading &mdash; contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body &mdash; can lead to unskillful mental states that are best cleared away by turning to mindfulness of in-and-out breathing. People who resist the theme of unattractiveness tend to focus on this passage, citing it as proof that the perception of unattractiveness is a dangerous and unhealthy meditation theme. However, <a href="#passage_54">&sect;54</a> points out that some strong defilements will respond only to this theme. And there is nothing inherently unhealthy about focusing on the unattractiveness of the body. Instead of fostering an unhealthy negative image of the body &mdash; in which other people's bodies are attractive while one's own is not &mdash; it fosters an accurate perception of aspects of the body that are often ignored, and yet which are unattractive in everybody. This sort of negative image is thus healthy, in that it helps cure the mind of its blind infatuations. Thus the two themes of breathing and unattractiveness are best practiced together, as complementary tools in one's meditative repertoire, to be mastered and honed so that they will be ready for use whenever needed.</p>

<p><b>Section Seven.</b> As mentioned above, the recollection of stilling &mdash; the topic of the final section &mdash; guarantees that mindfulness of death does not stop at the topic of death, but leads to the deathless. It also ensures that tranquility and insight do not stay focused on fabricated experiences, but incline to the unfabricated. Passage <a href="#passage_57">&sect;57</a> shows the ideal stage in the practice for this recollection: when one has mastered jhana and begun to see even its refined pleasures as inconstant, stressful, and not-self, this recollection helps to turn the mind in the direction of what lies beyond tranquility and insight: total Unbinding. As this passage points out, if &mdash; after utilizing this recollection &mdash; one still regards Unbinding as an object of passion, one's Awakening will not be complete. This is why the Buddha taught that all dhammas &mdash; not just fabricated ones &mdash; are to be seen as not-self, so as to overcome this passion. But when Unbinding is fully experienced not as an object, but as the end of objects, insight and tranquility are no longer needed for the purpose of liberation, and can be used instead simply as pleasant means of abiding until the end of one's life (see <a href="#passage_40">&sect;40</a>), when "all this" &mdash; the experience of the senses &mdash; "grows cold right here." (<a href="../../tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-044">Iti 44</a>)</p>

<h1><a id='six'>2. The First Six Recollections</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p><a id="passage_12"><b>&sect;12.</b></a> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park. Now at that time Mahanama... went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "I have heard that many monks are at work making robes for the Blessed One, (thinking,) 'When the robes are finished, at the end of the three months, the Blessed One will set out wandering.' For those of us living by means of various dwelling places [for the mind], by means of which dwelling place should we live?"</p>

<p>"Excellent, Mahanama, excellent! It is fitting for clansmen like you to approach the Tathagata and ask, 'For those of us living by means of various dwelling places [for the mind], by means of which dwelling place should we live?'</p>

<p>"One who is aroused to practice is one of conviction, not without conviction... is one with persistence aroused, not lazy... is one of established mindfulness, not muddled mindfulness... is centered in concentration, not uncentered. One aroused to practice is discerning, not undiscerning.</p>

<p>"Established in these five qualities, you should further develop six qualities:</p>

<p>[1] "There is the case where you recollect the Tathagata: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is pure and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Tathagata, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the Tathagata. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<p>"Mahanama, you should develop this recollection of the Buddha while you are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with children.</p>

<p>[2] "Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Dhamma, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the Dhamma. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<p>"Mahanama, you should develop this recollection of the Dhamma while you are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with children.</p>

<p>[3] "Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect the Sangha: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully &mdash; in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types &mdash; they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Sangha, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the Sangha. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<p>"Mahanama, you should develop this recollection of the Sangha while you are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with children.</p>

<p>[4] "Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect your own virtues: '(They are) untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, conducive to concentration.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting virtue, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on virtue. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<p>"Mahanama, you should develop this recollection of virtue while you are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with children.</p>

<p>[5] "Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect your own generosity: 'It is a gain, a great gain for me, that &mdash; among people overcome with the stain of possessiveness &mdash; I live at home, my awareness cleansed of the stain of possessiveness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous, responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting generosity, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on generosity. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<p>"Mahanama, you should develop this recollection of generosity while you are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with children.</p>

<p>[6] "Furthermore, you should recollect the devas: 'There are the devas of the Four Great Kings, the devas of the Thirty-three, the devas of the Hours, the Contented Devas, the devas who delight in creation, the devas who have power over the creations of others, the devas of Brahma's retinue, the devas beyond them. Whatever <i>conviction</i> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of conviction is present in me as well. Whatever <i>virtue</i> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of virtue is present in me as well. Whatever <i>learning</i> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of learning is present in me as well. Whatever <i>generosity</i> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of generosity is present in me as well. Whatever <i>discernment</i> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of discernment is present in me as well.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the conviction, virtue, learning, generosity, and discernment found both in himself and the devas, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the (qualities of the) devas. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<p>"Mahanama, you should develop this recollection of the devas while you are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with children."</p>

</div>


<div class='excerpt'>
<p><a id="passage_13"><b>&sect;13.</b></a> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migara's mother. Now at that time &mdash; it being the uposatha day &mdash; Visakha, Migara's mother, went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her, "Well now, Visakha, why are you coming in the middle of the day?"</p>

<p>"Today I'm observing the uposatha, lord."</p>

<p>"Visakha, there are these three uposathas. Which three? The uposatha of a cowherd, the uposatha of the Jains, and the uposatha of the Noble Ones.</p>

<p>"And what is the uposatha of a cowherd? Just as when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening, he reflects: 'Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this; they drank at this spot and that; tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this; they will drink at this spot and that'; in the same way, there is the case where a certain person observing the uposatha reflects, 'Today I ate this sort of non-staple food and that sort of staple food. Tomorrow I will eat that sort of non-staple food and this sort of staple food.' He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness, with that greed. Such is the uposatha of a cowherd, Visakha. When this uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or radiance.</p>

<p>"And what is the uposatha of the Jains? There are the contemplatives called the Niganthas [Jains]. They get their disciple to undertake the following practice: 'Here, my good man. Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than 100 leagues to the east... more than 100 leagues to the west... more than 100 leagues to the north... more than 100 leagues to the south.' Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness &amp; sympathy to some beings, but not to others.</p>

<p>"On the uposatha day, they get their disciple to undertake the following practice: 'Here, my good man. Having stripped off all your clothing, say this: "I am nothing by anything or of anything. Thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine."' Yet in spite of that, his parents know of him that 'This is our child.' And he knows of them that 'These are my parents.' His wives &amp; children know of him that 'This is our husband &amp; father.' And he knows of them that 'These are my wives &amp; children.' His workers &amp; slaves know of him that 'This is our master.' And he knows of them that 'These are my workers &amp; slaves.' Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness, he is persuaded to undertake falsehood. At the end of the night, he resumes the consumption of his belongings, even though they aren't given back to him. This counts as stealing, I tell you. Such is the uposatha of the Jains, Visakha. When this uposatha of the Jains is undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or radiance.</p>

<p>"And what is the uposatha of the Noble Ones? It is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique. And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique?</p>

<p>"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones recollects the Tathagata, thus: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is pure and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' As he is recollecting the Tathagata, his mind is brightened, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, just as when the head is cleansed through the proper technique. And how is the head cleansed through the proper technique? Through the use of cosmetic paste &amp; clay &amp; the appropriate human effort. This is how the head is cleansed through the proper technique. In the same way, the defiled mind is cleansed through the proper technique. And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the Tathagata... As he is recollecting the Tathagata, his mind is cleansed, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned. He is thus called a disciple of the noble ones undertaking the Brahma-uposatha. He lives with Brahma [= the Buddha]. It is owing to Brahma that his mind is brightened, that joy arises, and that whatever defilements there are in his mind are abandoned. This is how the mind is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>

<p>"[Again, the uposatha of the Noble Ones] is the cleansing of the mind through the proper technique. And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique?</p>

<p>"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the Dhamma, thus: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.' As he is recollecting the Dhamma, his mind is brightened, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, just as when the body is cleansed through the proper technique. And how is the body cleansed through the proper technique? Through the use of scouring balls &amp; bath powder &amp; the appropriate human effort. This is how the body is cleansed through the proper technique. In the same way, the defiled mind is cleansed through the proper technique. And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the Dhamma... As he is recollecting the Dhamma, his mind is cleansed, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned. He is thus called a disciple of the noble ones undertaking the Dhamma-uposatha. He lives with Dhamma. It is owing to Dhamma that his mind is brightened, that joy arises, and that whatever defilements there are in his mind are abandoned.

<p>"[Again, the uposatha of the Noble Ones] is the cleansing of the mind through the proper technique. And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique?</p>

<p>"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the Sangha, thus: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully &mdash; in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types &mdash; they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.' As he is recollecting the Sangha, his mind is brightened, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, just as when clothing is cleansed through the proper technique.

<p>"[Again, the uposatha of the Noble Ones] is the cleansing of the mind through the proper technique. And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique?</p>

<p>"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects his own virtues, thus: '(They are) untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, conducive to concentration.' As he is recollecting virtue, his mind is brightened, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, just as when a mirror is cleansed through the proper technique.

<p>"[Again, the uposatha of the Noble Ones] is the cleansing of the mind through the proper technique. And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique?</p>

<p>"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the devas, thus: 'There are the devas of the Four Great Kings, the devas of the Thirty-three, the devas of the Hours, the Contented Devas, the devas who delight in creation, the devas who have power over the creations of others, the devas of Brahma's retinue, the devas beyond them. Whatever conviction they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of conviction is present in me as well.

As he is recollecting the devas, his mind is brightened, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, just as when a gold is cleansed through the proper technique. And how is gold cleansed through the proper technique? Through the use of a furnace, salt earth, red chalk, a blow-pipe, tongs, &amp; the appropriate human effort.

This is how the mind is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones reflects thus: 'As long as they live, the arahants &mdash; abandoning the taking of life &mdash; abstain from the taking of life. They dwell with their rod laid down, their knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Today I too, for this day &amp; night &mdash; abandoning the taking of life &mdash; abstain from the taking of life. I dwell with my rod laid down, my knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. By means of this factor I emulate the arahants, and my uposatha will be observed.</p>

<p>"'As long as they live, the arahants &mdash; abandoning the taking of what is not given &mdash; abstains from taking what is not given. They take only what is given, accept only what is given, live not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. Today I too, for this day &amp; night &mdash; abandoning the taking of what is not given &mdash; abstain from taking what is not given. I take only what is given, accept only what is given, live not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. By means of this factor I emulate the arahants, and my uposatha will be observed.</p>

<p>"'As long as they live, the arahants &mdash; abandoning uncelibacy &mdash; live a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way. Today I too, for this day &amp; night &mdash; abandoning uncelibacy &mdash; live a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way. By means of this factor I emulate the arahants, and my uposatha will be observed.</p>

<p>"'As long as they live, the arahants &mdash; abandoning false speech &mdash; abstain from false speech. They speak the truth, hold to the truth, are firm, reliable, no deceivers of the world. Today I too, for this day &amp; night &mdash; abandoning false speech &mdash; abstain from false speech. I speak the truth, hold to the truth, am firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. By means of this factor I emulate the arahants, and my uposatha will be observed.</p>

<p>"'As long as they live, the arahants &mdash; abandoning fermented &amp; distilled liquors that cause heedlessness &mdash; abstain from fermented &amp; distilled liquors that cause heedlessness. Today I too, for this day &amp; night &mdash; abandoning fermented &amp; distilled liquors that cause heedlessness &mdash; abstain from fermented &amp; distilled liquors that cause heedlessness. By means of this factor I emulate the arahants, and my uposatha will be observed.</p>

<p>"'As long as they live, the arahants live on one meal a day, abstaining from food at night, refraining from food at the wrong time of day [from noon until dawn]. Today I too, for this day &amp; night, live on one meal, abstaining from food at night, refraining from food at the wrong time of day. By means of this factor I emulate the arahants, and my uposatha will be observed.</p>

<p>"'As long as they live, the arahants abstain from dancing, singing, music, watching shows, wearing garlands, beautifying themselves with perfumes &amp; cosmetics. Today I too, for this day &amp; night, abstain from dancing, singing, music, watching shows, wearing garlands, beautifying myself with perfumes &amp; cosmetics.

<p>"'As long as they live, the arahants &mdash; abandoning high &amp; imposing seats &amp; beds &mdash; abstain from high &amp; imposing seats &amp; beds. They make low beds, on a pallet or a spread of straw. Today I too, for this day &amp; night &mdash; abandoning high &amp; imposing seats &amp; beds &mdash; abstain from high &amp; imposing seats &amp; beds.

<p>"Such is the uposatha of the Noble Ones, Visakha. When this uposatha of the Noble Ones is undertaken, it is of great fruit &amp; great benefit, of great glory &amp; radiance. And how is it of great fruit &amp; great benefit, of great glory &amp; radiance?</p>

<p>"Suppose that one were to exercise kingship, rule, and sovereignty over these sixteen great lands replete with the seven treasures, i.e., over the Angas, Maghadans, Kasis, Kosalans, Vajjians, Mallas, Cetis, Vamsas, Kurus, Pa&ntilde;calas, Macchas, Surasenas, Assakas, Avantis, Gandharans, &amp; Kambojans: It would not be worth one-sixteenth of this uposatha endowed with eight factors. Why is that? Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss.</p>

<p>"Fifty human years are equal to one day &amp; night among the Devas of the Four Great Kings. Thirty such days &amp; nights make a month. Twelve such months make a year. Five hundred such heavenly years is the life-span among the Devas of the Four Great Kings. Now, it is possible that a certain man or woman &mdash; from having observed this uposatha endowed with eight factors &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death, might be reborn among the Devas of the Four Great Kings.

<p><a id="passage_14"><b>&sect;14.</b></a> The Blessed One said, "Monks, once the devas &amp; asuras were arrayed for battle. Then Sakka, the chief of the devas, addressed the devas of the Thirty-three: 'If, dear sirs, when the devas have gone into battle, there should arise fear, terror, or horripilation, then on that occasion you should catch sight of the top of my standard. For when you have caught sight of the top of my standard, whatever fear, terror, or horripilation there is will be abandoned.</p>

<p>"'If you can't catch sight of the top of my standard, then you should catch sight of the top of the deva-king Pajapati's standard...</p>

<p>"'If you can't catch sight of the top of the deva-king Pajapati's standard, then you should catch sight of the top of the deva-king Varuna's standard...</p>

<p>"'If you can't catch sight of the top of the deva-king Varuna's standard, then you should catch sight of the top of the deva-king Isana's standard. For when you have caught sight of the top of the deva-king Isana's standard, whatever fear, terror, or horripilation there is will be abandoned.'</p>

<p>"But, monks, when the top of the deva-chief Sakka's standard is caught sight of, or when the top of the deva-king Pajapati's standard... the top of the deva-king Varuna's standard... or the top of the deva-king Isana's standard is caught sight of, whatever fear, terror, or horripilation there is may be abandoned or may <i>not</i> be abandoned. Why is that? Because Sakka the chief of the devas is not devoid of passion, not devoid of aversion, not devoid of delusion. He feels fear, feels terror, feels dread. He runs away.</p>

<p>"But I tell you this: If &mdash; when you have gone into the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; there should arise fear, terror, or horripilation, then on that occasion you should recollect me: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' For when you have recollected me, whatever fear, terror, or horripilation there is will be abandoned.</p>

<p>"If you can't recollect me, then you should recollect the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.' For when you have recollected the Dhamma, whatever fear, terror, or horripilation there is will be abandoned.</p>

<p>"If you can't recollect the Dhamma, then you should recollect the Sangha: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully &mdash; in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types &mdash; they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the unexcelled field of merit for the world.' For when you have recollected the Sangha, whatever fear, terror, or horripilation where is will be abandoned. Why is that? Because the Tathagata &mdash; worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened &mdash; is devoid of passion, devoid of aversion, devoid of delusion. He feels no fear, feels no terror, feels no dread. He doesn't run away."</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One-well-gone, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
In the wilderness,
in the shade of a tree,
in an empty building, monks,
recollect the Buddha.
	Your fear won't exist.
	
If you can't recall the Buddha
	 &mdash; best in the world,
	the bull of men &mdash;
then you should recall the Dhamma:
	leading outward, well-taught.
	
If you can't recall the Dhamma
	 &mdash; leading outward,
	well-taught &mdash;
then you should recall the Sangha:
	the field of merit unexcelled.
	
When thus recalling
the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha, monks,
there'll be no horripilation,
terror,
or fear.

<p>Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p><a id="passage_17"><b>&sect;17.</b></a> The Blessed One [speaking to Saccaka Aggivessana] said, "And how is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind? There is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in an uneducated run-of-the-mill person. On being touched by the pleasant feeling, he becomes impassioned with pleasure, and is reduced to being impassioned with pleasure. His pleasant feeling ceases. With the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling. On being touched with the painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves, &amp; laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. When that pleasant feeling had arisen in him, it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the body. When that painful feeling had arisen in him, it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the mind. This is how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind.</p>

<p>"And how is one developed in body and developed in mind? There is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in a well-educated disciple of the noble ones. On being touched by the pleasant feeling, he doesn't become impassioned with pleasure, and is not reduced to being impassioned with pleasure. His pleasant feeling ceases. With the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling. On being touched with the painful feeling, he doesn't sorrow, grieve, or lament, beat his breast or becomes distraught. When that pleasant feeling had arisen in him, it didn't invade his mind and remain because of his development of the body. When that painful feeling had arisen in him, it didn't invade his mind and remain because of his development of the mind. This is how one is developed in body and developed in mind."</p>

<p>"I have confidence in Master Gotama that Master Gotama is developed in body and developed in mind."</p>

<p>""Well, Aggivessana, you are certainly being rude and presumptuously speaking your words, but nevertheless I will respond to you. Ever since I shaved my hair &amp; beard, put on the ochre robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness, it has not been possible for a pleasant feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain, or for a painful feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain."</p>

<p>"But perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of pleasant feeling that, having arisen, would invade the mind and remain. Perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of painful feeling that, having arisen, would invade the mind and remain."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't it have, Aggivessana? Before my Awakening, when I was still an unawakened bodhisatta, the thought occurred to me: 'Household life is confining, a dusty path. Life gone forth is the open air. It isn't easy, living in a home, to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, a polished shell. What if I, having shaved off my hair &amp; beard and putting on the ochre robe, were to go forth from the household life into homelessness?'</p>

<p>"So at a later time, when I was still young, black-haired, endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life, having shaved off my hair &amp; beard &mdash; though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces &mdash; I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness.</p>

<p>"Having gone forth in search of what might be skillful, seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace, I went to Alara Kalama and, on arrival, said to him: 'Friend Kalama, I want to practice in this doctrine &amp; discipline.'</p>

<p>"When this was said, he replied to me, 'You may stay here, my friend. This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter &amp; dwell in his own teacher's knowledge, having realized it for himself through direct knowledge.'</p>

<p>"It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine. As far as mere lip-reciting &amp; repetition, I could speak the words of knowledge, the words of the elders, and I could affirm that I knew &amp; saw &mdash; I, along with others.</p>

<p>"I thought: 'It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares, "I have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge." Certainly he dwells knowing &amp; seeing this Dhamma.' So I went to him and said, 'To what extent do you declare that you have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma?' When this was said, he declared the dimension of nothingness.</p>

<p>"I thought: 'Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, &amp; discernment. I, too, have conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, &amp; discernment. What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered &amp; dwells in, having realized it for himself through direct knowledge.' So it was not long before I quickly entered &amp; dwelled in that Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge. I went to him and said, 'Friend Kalama, is this the extent to which you have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, my friend...'</p>

<p>"'This, friend, is the extent to which I, too, have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge.'</p>

<p>"'It is a gain for us, my friend, a great gain for us, that we have such a companion in the holy life. So the Dhamma I declare I have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge, is the Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge. And the Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge, is the Dhamma I declare I have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge. The Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know; the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I know. As I am, so are you; as you are, so am I. Come friend, let us now lead this community together.'</p>

<p>"In this way did Alara Kalama, my teacher, place me, his pupil, on the same level with himself and pay me great honor. But the thought occurred to me, 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness.' So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.</p>

<p>"In search of what might be skillful, seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace, I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and, on arrival, said to him: 'Friend Uddaka, I want to practice in this doctrine &amp; discipline.'</p>

<p>"When this was said, he replied to me, 'You may stay here, my friend. This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter &amp; dwell in his own teacher's knowledge, having realized it for himself through direct knowledge.'</p>

<p>"It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine. As far as mere lip-reciting &amp; repetition, I could speak the words of knowledge, the words of the elders, and I could affirm that I knew &amp; saw &mdash; I, along with others.</p>

<p>"I thought: 'It wasn't through mere conviction alone that Rama declared, "I have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge." Certainly he dwelled knowing &amp; seeing this Dhamma.' So I went to Uddaka and said, 'To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered &amp; dwelled in this Dhamma?' When this was said, Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

<p>"I thought: 'Not only did Rama have conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, &amp; discernment. I, too, have conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, &amp; discernment. What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered &amp; dwelled in, having realized it for himself through direct knowledge.' So it was not long before I quickly entered &amp; dwelled in that Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge. I went to Uddaka and said, 'Friend Uddaka, is this the extent to which Rama entered &amp; dwelled in this Dhamma, having realized it for himself through direct knowledge?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, my friend...'</p>

<p>"'This, friend, is the extent to which I, too, have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge.'</p>

<p>"'It is a gain for us, my friend, a great gain for us, that we have such a companion in the holy life. So the Dhamma Rama declared he entered &amp; dwelled in, having realized it for himself through direct knowledge, is the Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge. And the Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge, is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered &amp; dwelled in, having realized it for himself through direct knowledge. The Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know; the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knew. As he was, so are you; as you are, so was he. Come friend, lead this community.'</p>

<p>"In this way did Uddaka Ramaputta, my companion in the holy life, place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor. But the thought occurred to me, 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.' So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.</p>

<p>"In search of what might be skillful, seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace, I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of Uruvela. There I saw some delightful countryside, with an inspiring forest grove, a clear-flowing river with fine, delightful banks, and villages for alms-going on all sides. The thought occurred to me: 'How delightful is this countryside, with its inspiring forest grove, clear-flowing river with fine, delightful banks, and villages for alms-going on all sides. This is just right for the striving of a clansman intent on striving.' So I sat down right there, thinking, 'This is just right for striving.'</p>

<p>"Then these three similes &mdash; spontaneous, never before heard &mdash; appeared to me. Suppose there were a wet, sappy piece of timber lying in the water, and a man were to come along with an upper fire-stick, thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.' Now what do you think? Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper fire-stick in the wet, sappy timber lying in the water?"</p>

<p>"No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because the timber is wet &amp; sappy, and besides it is lying in the water. Eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness &amp; disappointment."</p>

<p>"So it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body &amp; mind, and whose desire, infatuation, urge, thirst, &amp; fever for sensuality is not relinquished &amp; stilled within him: Whether or not he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings due to his striving [for Awakening], he is incapable of knowledge, vision, &amp; unexcelled self-awakening. This was the first simile &mdash; spontaneous, never before heard &mdash; that appeared to me.</p>

<p>"Then a second simile &mdash; spontaneous, never before heard &mdash; appeared to me. Suppose there were a wet, sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water, and a man were to come along with an upper fire-stick, thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.' Now what do you think? Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper fire-stick in the wet, sappy timber lying on land far from water?"</p>

<p>"No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because the timber is wet &amp; sappy, even though it is lying on land far from water. Eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness &amp; disappointment."</p>

<p>"So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only, but whose desire, infatuation, urge, thirst, &amp; fever for sensuality is not relinquished &amp; stilled within him: Whether or not he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings due to his striving, he is incapable of knowledge, vision, &amp; unexcelled self-awakening. This was the second simile &mdash; spontaneous, never before heard &mdash; that appeared to me.</p>

<p>"Then a third simile &mdash; spontaneous, never before heard &mdash; appeared to me. Suppose there were a dry, sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water, and a man were to come along with an upper fire-stick, thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.' Now what do you think? Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper fire-stick in the dry, sapless timber lying on land?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because the timber is dry &amp; sapless, and besides it is lying on land far from water."</p>

<p>"So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body &amp; mind, and whose desire, infatuation, urge, thirst, &amp; fever for sensuality is relinquished &amp; stilled within him: Whether or not he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings due to his striving, he is capable of knowledge, vision, &amp; unexcelled self-awakening. This was the third simile &mdash; spontaneous, never before heard &mdash; that appeared to me.</p>

<p>"I thought: 'Suppose that I, clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth, were to beat down, constrain, &amp; crush my mind with my awareness.' So, clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth, I beat down, constrained, &amp; crushed my mind with my awareness. Just as a strong man, seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders, would beat him down, constrain, &amp; crush him, in the same way I beat down, constrained, &amp; crushed my mind with my awareness. As I did so, sweat poured from my armpits. And although tireless persistence was aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness established, my body was aroused &amp; uncalm because of the painful exertion. But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain.</p>

<p>"I thought: 'Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of non-breathing.' So I stopped the in-breaths &amp; out-breaths in my nose &amp; mouth. As I did so, there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my ear holes, just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smith's bellows... So I stopped the in-breaths &amp; out-breaths in my nose &amp; mouth &amp; ears. As I did so, extreme forces sliced through my head, just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword... Extreme pains arose in my head, just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head... Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity, just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox... There was an extreme burning in my body, just as if two strong men, grabbing a weaker man by the arms, were to roast &amp; broil him over a pit of hot embers. And although tireless persistence was aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness established, my body was aroused &amp; uncalm because of the painful exertion. But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain.</p>

<p>"Devas, on seeing me, said, 'Gotama the contemplative is dead.' Other devas said, 'He isn't dead, he's dying.' Others said, 'He's neither dead nor dying, he's an arahant, for this is the way arahants live.'</p>

<p>"I thought: 'Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food.' Then devas came to me and said, 'Dear sir, please don't practice going altogether without food. If you go altogether without food, we'll infuse divine nourishment in through your pores, and you will survive on that.' I thought, 'If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores, I would be lying.' So I dismissed them, saying, 'Enough.'</p>

<p>"I thought: 'Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time, only a handful at a time of bean soup, lentil soup, vetch soup, or pea soup.' So I took only a little food at a time, only a handful at a time of bean soup, lentil soup, vetch soup, or pea soup. My body became extremely emaciated. Simply from my eating so little, my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems... My backside became like a camel's hoof...  My spine stood out like a string of beads...  My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old, run-down barn... The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well...  My scalp shriveled &amp; withered like a green bitter gourd, shriveled &amp; withered in the heat &amp; the wind...  The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly, I grabbed hold of my spine as well; and when I thought of touching my spine, I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well...  If I urinated or defecated, I fell over on my face right there...  Simply from my eating so little, if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair &mdash; rotted at its roots &mdash; fell from my body as I rubbed, simply from eating so little.</p>

<p>"People on seeing me would say, 'Gotama the contemplative is black.' Other people would say, 'Gotama the contemplative isn't black, he's brown.' Others would say, 'Gotama the contemplative is neither black nor brown, he's golden-skinned.' So much had the clear, bright color of my skin deteriorated, simply from eating so little.</p>

<p> "I thought: 'Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful, racking, piercing feelings due to their striving, this is the utmost. None have been greater than this. Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future will feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to their striving, this is the utmost. None will be greater than this. Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the present are feeling painful, racking, piercing feelings due to their striving, this is the utmost. None is greater than this. But with this racking practice of austerities I haven't attained any superior human state, any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones. Could there be another path to Awakening?'</p>

<p>"I thought: 'I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, then &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities &mdash; I entered &amp; remained in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. Could that be the path to Awakening?' Then following on that memory came the realization: 'That is the path to Awakening.' I thought: 'So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality, nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities?' I thought: 'I am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality, nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities, but that pleasure is not easy to achieve with a body so extremely emaciated. Suppose I were to take some solid food: some rice &amp; porridge.' So I took some solid food: some rice &amp; porridge. Now five monks had been attending on me, thinking, 'If Gotama, our contemplative, achieves some higher state, he will tell us.' But when they saw me taking some solid food &mdash; some rice &amp; porridge &mdash; they were disgusted and left me, thinking, 'Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriously. He has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundance.'</p>

<p>"So when I had taken solid food and regained strength, then &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities, I entered &amp; remained in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, I entered &amp; remained in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain. With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and sensed pleasure with the body. I entered &amp; remained in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain. With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of joys &amp; distresses &mdash; I entered &amp; remained in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain.</p>

<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes &amp; details.</p>

<p>"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain.</p>

<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away &amp; reappearance of beings. I saw &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings &mdash; who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings &mdash; who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech &amp; mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; I saw beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.</p>

<p>"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain.</p>

<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations. I discerned, as it had come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

<p>"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain.</p>

<p>"I recall having taught the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds, and yet each one of them assumes of me, 'Gotama the contemplative is teaching the Dhamma attacking just me,' but it shouldn't be seen in that way. The Tathagata rightly teaches them the Dhamma simply for the purpose of giving knowledge. At the end of that very talk I steady the mind inwardly, settle it, concentrate it, and unify it in the same theme of concentration as before, in which I almost constantly dwell."</p>

<p>"That is credible for the Master Gotama, as would be the case for one who is worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened. But does the Master Gotama recall sleeping during the day?"</p>

<p>"I recall, Aggivessana, in the last month of the hot season, after the meal, returning from my almsround, setting out my outer robe folded in four, lying down on my right side, and falling asleep while mindful &amp; alert."</p>

<p>"There are some brahmans &amp; contemplatives, Master Gotama, who would call that dwelling in delusion."</p>

<p>"It's not to that extent that one is deluded or undeluded, Aggivessana. As to how one is deluded or undeluded, listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

<p>"As you say, Master Gotama," Saccaka responded.</p>

<p>The Blessed One said: "In whomever the fermentations that defile, that lead to renewed becoming, that give trouble, that ripen in stress, and lead to future birth, aging, &amp; death are not abandoned: Him I call deluded. For it is from not abandoning the fermentations that one is deluded. In whomever the fermentations that defile, that lead to renewed becoming, that give trouble, that ripen in stress, and lead to future birth, aging, &amp; death <i>are</i> abandoned: Him I call undeluded. For it is from abandoning the fermentations that one is undeluded. In the Tathagata, Aggivessana, the fermentations that defile, that lead to renewed becoming, that give trouble, that ripen in stress, and lead to future birth, aging, &amp; death have been abandoned, their root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. Just as a palmyra cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth, in the same way in the Tathagata the fermentations that defile, that lead to renewed becoming, that give trouble, that ripen in stress, and lead to future birth, aging, &amp; death have been abandoned, their root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising."</p>

<p>"Gotami, the qualities of which you may know, 'These qualities lead to passion, not to dispassion; to being fettered, not to being unfettered; to accumulating, not to shedding; to self-aggrandizement, not to modesty; to discontent, not to contentment; to entanglement, not to seclusion; to laziness, not to aroused persistence; to being burdensome, not to being unburdensome': You may definitely hold, 'This is not the Dhamma, this is not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher's instruction.'</p>

<p>"I would take it out, venerable sir. If I couldn't get it out right away, then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right, I would take it out, even if it meant drawing blood. Why is that? Because I have sympathy for the young boy."</p>

<p><a id="passage_22"><b>&sect;22.</b></a> Then Kevatta the householder approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this Nalanda is powerful, both prosperous and populous, filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a marvel of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One."</p>

<p>When this was said, the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder, "Kevatta, I don't teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, display a marvel of psychic power to the lay people clad in white.'"</p>

<p>A second time... A third time, Kevatta the householder said to the Blessed One: "I won't argue with the Blessed One, but I tell you: Venerable sir, this Nalanda is powerful, both prosperous and populous, filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a marvel of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One."</p>

<p>A third time, the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder, "Kevatta, I don't teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, display a marvel of psychic power to the lay people clad in white.'</p>

<p>"Kevatta, there are these three marvels that I have declared, having directly known and realized them for myself. Which three? The marvel of psychic power, the marvel of telepathy, and the marvel of instruction.</p>

<p>"And what is the marvel of psychic power? There is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>

<p>"Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction, telling him, 'Isn't it awesome. Isn't it astounding, how great the power, how great the prowess of this contemplative. Just now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.'</p>

<p>"Then the person without faith, without conviction, would say to the person with faith and with conviction: 'Sir, there is a charm called the Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.' What do you think, Kevatta &mdash; isn't that what the man without faith, without conviction, would say to the man with faith and with conviction?"</p>

<p>"That's what he would say, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Seeing this drawback to the marvel of psychic power, Kevatta, I feel repelled, ashamed, &amp; disgusted with the marvel of psychic power.</p>

<p>"And what is the marvel of telepathy? There is the case where a monk reads the minds, the mental events, the thoughts, the ponderings of other beings, other individuals, (saying,) 'Such is your thinking, here is where your thinking is, thus is your mind.'</p>

<p>"Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him reading the minds... of other beings... He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction, telling him, 'Isn't it awesome. Isn't it astounding, how great the power, how great the prowess of this contemplative. Just now I saw him reading the minds... of other beings...'</p>

<p>Then the person without faith, without conviction, would say to the person with faith and with conviction: 'Sir, there is a charm called the Manika charm by which the monk read the minds... of other beings...' What do you think, Kevatta &mdash; isn't that what the man without faith, without conviction, would say to the man with faith and with conviction?"</p>

<p>"That's what he would say, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Seeing this drawback to the marvel of telepathy, Kevatta, I feel repelled, ashamed, &amp; disgusted with the marvel of telepathy.</p>

<p>"And what is the marvel of instruction? There is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way: 'Direct your thought in this way, don't direct it in that. Attend to things in this way, don't attend to them in that. Let go of this, enter and remain in that.' This, Kevatta, is called the marvel of instruction.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.</p>

<p>"A householder or householder's son, hearing the Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: 'Household life is confining, a dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'</p>

<p>"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>

<p>"When he has thus gone forth, he [follows the Buddha's instructions until, after attaining the fourth jhana:] With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge &amp; vision... to creating a mind-made body... to the modes of supranormal powers... to the divine ear-element... to knowledge of the awareness of other beings... to knowledge of the recollection of past lives... to knowledge of the passing away &amp; re-appearance of beings... to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen &mdash; clear, limpid, and unsullied &mdash; where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, and unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

<p><i><a id="passage_27"><b>&sect;27.</b></a></i> <i>A bandit chief:</i></p>

<div class="freeverse">
"Those who
	for the sake of sacrifice
	for the sake of wealth
we have killed in the past,
	against their will
	have trembled &amp; babbled
	from fear.
But you &mdash;
	you show no fear;
	your complexion brightens.
Why don't you lament
in the face of what's greatly to be feared?"

<i>Ven. Adhimutta</i>:

"There are no painful mind-states, chieftain,
in one without longing.
In one whose fetters are ended,
all fears are overcome.
With the ending of (craving)
the guide to becoming,
when phenomena are seen
	for what they are,
then as in the laying down of a burden,
there's no fear in death.

I've lived well the holy life,
well-developed the path.
Death holds no fear for me.
It's like the end of a disease.
I've 	lived well the holy life,
		well-developed the path,
		seen states of becoming
as devoid of allure,
like poison spit out
after it's drunk.

One gone to the far shore
without clinging, without
fermentation
his task completed,
welcomes the ending of life,
as if freed from a place of execution.
Having attained the supreme Rightness,
unconcerned with all the world,
as if released from a burning house,
	he doesn't sorrow at death.
	
Whatever's compounded,
wherever a state of becoming's obtained,
all that has no one in charge:
	so says the Great Seer.
Whoever discerns this,
as taught by the Awakened One,
would no more grasp hold
of any state of becoming
than he would
a hot iron ball.
I have no 'I was,'
	no 'I will be.'
Fabrications will simply
go out of existence.
	What's to lament there in that?
For one who sees, as it has come to be,
the pure arising of phenomena,
the pure seriality of fabrications,
	there's no fear.
	
When seeing the world,
	with discernment,
as on a par
with grass &amp; twigs,
finding no 'mine-ness,'
thinking, 'There's nothing of mine,'
	he feels no sorrow.
Dissatisfied with this carcass,
I'm unconcerned with becoming.
This body will break up
and there will not be another.
	Do as you like with this carcass.
	From that I will feel
	neither hatred nor love."
	
Hearing these awesome, hair-raising words,
the young men threw down their weapons &amp; said:

"What have you done, sir,
or who have you taken as mentor?
Because of whose teachings
is this lack of sorrow acquired?"

<i>Ven. Adhimutta:</i>
"The	all-knowing,
		all-seeing conqueror:
He is my mentor.
Greatly compassionate teacher,
all the world's healer,
this doctrine is his,
unexcelled, leading to ending.
Because of his teachings
is this lack of sorrow acquired."

The bandits, hearing the good words of the seer,
threw down their swords &amp; their weapons.
Some relinquished their life of crime,
some chose the Going Forth.
Having gone forth in the teachings
of the one well-gone,
developing the powers &amp; factors for Awakening,
	wise, happy,
	exultant in mind,
	their faculties ripened,
they touched uncompounded Unbinding.

<div class='excerpt'>
<p><a id="passage_28"><b>&sect;28.</b></a> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then Ven. Maha Kassapa went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him, "You are now old, Kassapa. Your robes made of cast-off hemp rags are heavy for you. So wear robes donated by householders, eat invitational meals, and live close by me."</p>

<p>"Lord, for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness. I have been an almsgoer and have extolled being an almsgoer. I have worn cast off rags and have extolled wearing cast off rags. I have worn only one set of the triple robe and have extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe. I have been modest and have extolled being modest. I have been content and have extolled being content. I have been reclusive and have extolled being reclusive. I have been unentangled and have extolled being unentangled. I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused."</p>

<p>"But, Kassapa, what compelling reason do you see that you for a long time have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness... that you have kept your persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused?"</p>

<p>"Lord, I see two compelling reasons that for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness... that I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused: seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the here &amp; now, and feeling sympathy for later generations: 'Perhaps later generations will take it as an example: "It seems that the disciples of the Awakened One and those who awakened after him lived for a long time in the wilderness and extolled living in the wilderness; were almsgoers and extolled being almsgoers; wore cast off rags and extolled wearing cast off rags; wore only one set of the triple robe and extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe; were modest and extolled being modest; were content and extolled being content; were reclusive and extolled being reclusive; were unentangled and extolled being unentangled; kept their persistence aroused and extolled having persistence aroused."'"</p>

<p>"Good, Kassapa. Very good. It seems that you are one who practices for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, &amp; happiness of beings human &amp; divine. So continue wearing your robes of cast off hemp cloth, go for alms, and live in the wilderness."</p>

<p><a id="passage_29"><b>&sect;29.</b></a> "Endowed with five qualities, a monk pursuing mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked (release). Which five?</p>

<p>"He is a person who imposes only a little (on others): one of few duties &amp; projects, easy to support, easily contented with the requisites of life.</p>

<p>"He is a person who eats only a little food, committed to not indulging his stomach.</p>

<p>"He is a person of only a little sloth, committed to wakefulness.</p>

<p>"He is a person of much learning, who has retained what he heard, has stored what he has heard. Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end, that &mdash; in their meaning &amp; expression &mdash; proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete &amp; pure: those he has listened to often, retained, discussed, accumulated, examined with his mind, and well-penetrated in terms of his views... He gets to hear at will, easily &amp; without difficulty, talk that is truly sobering &amp; conducive to the opening of awareness: talk on modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge &amp; vision of release... He lives in the wilderness, in an isolated dwelling place.</p>

<p> <a id="passage_30"><b>&sect;30.</b></a> "Mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, when developed &amp; pursued, is of great fruit, of great benefit. Mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, when developed &amp; pursued, brings the four frames of reference to their culmination. The four frames of reference, when developed &amp; pursued, bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination. The seven factors for Awakening, when developed &amp; pursued, bring clear knowing &amp; release to their culmination.</p>

<h4>Mindfulness of In-&amp;-out Breathing</h4>

<p>"Now how is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing developed &amp; pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit?</p>

<p> "There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>

<p>"[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' [2] Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' [3] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' [4] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication [in-&amp;-out breathing].' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'</p>

<p>"[5] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture.' [6] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure.' [7] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication [feeling &amp; perception].' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication.' [8] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication.'</p>

<p>"[9] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind.' [10] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind.' [11] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in steadying the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out steadying the mind.' [12] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in releasing the mind.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out releasing the mind.'</p>

<p>"[13] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy.' [14] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion <i>[literally,</i> fading].' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion.' [15] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation.' [16] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.'</p>

<p>"This is how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is developed &amp; pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit.</p>

<h4>The Four Frames of Reference</h4>

<p>"And how is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination?</p>

<p>"[1] On whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, discerns, 'I am breathing out long'; or breathing in short, discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, discerns, 'I am breathing out short'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to the entire body'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out calming bodily fabrication': On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this &mdash; the in-&amp;-out breath &mdash; is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"[2] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to rapture'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to pleasure'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to mental fabrication'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out calming mental fabrication': On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>feelings</i> in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash;  putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this &mdash; careful attention to in-&amp;-out breaths &mdash; is classed as a feeling among feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"[3] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out sensitive to the mind'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out gladdening the mind'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out steadying the mind'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out releasing the mind': On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>mind</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash;  putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. I don't say that there is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing in one of lapsed mindfulness and no alertness, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on inconstancy'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on dispassion'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on cessation'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in... &amp;... out focusing on relinquishment': On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>mental qualities</i> in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash;  putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He who sees with discernment the abandoning of greed &amp; distress is one who watches carefully with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<p>"This is how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination.</p>

<h4>The Seven Factors for Awakening</h4>

<p>"And how are the four frames of reference developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination?</p>

<p>[1] "On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady &amp; without lapse. When his mindfulness is steady &amp; without lapse, then <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[2] "Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment. When he remains mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, &amp; coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[3] "In one who examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is aroused. When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then <i>persistence</i> as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[4] "In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises. When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused, then <i>rapture</i> as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[5] "For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the mind grows calm. When the body &amp; mind of an enraptured monk grow calm, then <i>calm</i> as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[6] "For one who is at ease &mdash; his body calmed &mdash; the mind becomes concentrated. When the mind of one who is at ease &mdash; his body calmed &mdash; becomes concentrated, then <i>concentration</i> as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[7] "He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity. When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, <i>equanimity</i> as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>

<p>[Similarly with the other three frames of reference: feelings, mind, &amp; mental qualities.]</p>

<p>"This is how the four frames of reference are developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination.</p>

<h4>Clear Knowing &amp; Release</h4>

<p>"And how are the seven factors for Awakening developed &amp; pursued so as to bring clear knowing &amp; release to their culmination? There is the case where a monk develops <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor for Awakening... <i>persistence</i> as a factor for Awakening... <i>rapture</i> as a factor for Awakening... <i>calm</i> as a factor for Awakening... <i>concentration</i> as a factor for Awakening... <i>equanimity</i> as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in relinquishment.</p>

<p>"This is how the seven factors for Awakening are developed &amp; pursued so as to bring clear knowing &amp; release to their culmination."</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<p>"So if a monk should wish: 'May neither my body be fatigued nor my eyes, and may my mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, be released from fermentations,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p> "If a monk should wish: 'May I &mdash; in the presence of what is loathsome &amp; what is not &mdash; cutting myself off from both &mdash; remain equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enter &amp; remain in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' enter &amp; remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' enter &amp; remain in the dimension of nothingness,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, enter &amp; remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enter &amp; remain in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>

<p>"When concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is thus developed, thus pursued, then if he senses a feeling of pleasure, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of pain, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of pleasure, he senses it disjoined from it. If he senses a feeling of pain, he senses it disjoined from it. If he senses a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he senses it disjoined from it. When sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.' He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, everything that is experienced, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'</p>

<p>"Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil &amp; wick; and from the termination of the oil &amp; wick &mdash; and from not being provided any other sustenance &mdash; it goes out unnourished; in the same way, when sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.'

<p><a id="passage_33"><b>&sect;33.</b></a> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Wood, at the Gabled Hall. Now on that occasion the Blessed One, with many lines of reasoning, was giving the monks a talk on the unattractiveness (of the body), was speaking in praise of (the perception of) unattractiveness, was speaking in praise of the development of (the perception of) unattractiveness. Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, I wish to go into seclusion for half a month. I am not to be approached by anyone at all except for the one who brings almsfood."</p>

<p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him. And no one approached the Blessed One except for the one who brought almsfood.</p>

<p>Then the monks &mdash; (thinking,) "The Blessed One, with many lines of reasoning, has given a talk on the unattractiveness (of the body), has spoken in praise of (the perception of) unattractiveness, has spoken in praise of the development of (the perception of) unattractiveness" &mdash; remained committed to the development of (the perception of) unattractiveness in many modes &amp; manners. They &mdash; ashamed, repelled, &amp; disgusted with this body &mdash; sought for an assassin. In one day, ten monks took the knife. In one day, twenty monks took the knife. In one day, thirty monks took the knife.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion after half a month's time, said to Ven. Ananda, "Ananda, why does the community of monks seem so depleted?"</p>

<p>"Because, lord, the Blessed One, with many lines of reasoning, gave the monks a talk on the unattractiveness (of the body), spoke in praise of (the perception of) unattractiveness, spoke in praise of the development of (the perception of) unattractiveness. The monks... remained committed to the development of (the perception of) unattractiveness in many modes &amp; manners. They &mdash; ashamed, repelled, &amp; disgusted with this body &mdash; sought for an assassin. In one day, ten monks... twenty monks... thirty monks took the knife. It would be good, lord, if the Blessed One would explain another method so that this community of monks might be established in gnosis."</p>

<p>"In that case, Ananda, gather in the assembly hall all the monks who live in dependence on Vesali."</p>

<p> "As you say, lord," Ven. Ananda responded. When he had gathered in the assembly hall all the monks who lived in dependence on Vesali, he went to the Blessed One and said, "The community of monks is gathered, lord. Now is the time to do as the Blessed One sees fit."</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made ready. As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: "Monks, this concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, when developed &amp; pursued, is both peaceful &amp; exquisite, a refreshing &amp; pleasant abiding that immediately disperses &amp; allays any evil, unskillful (mental) qualities that have arisen. Just as when, in the last month of the hot season, a great rain-cloud out of season immediately disperses &amp; allays the dust &amp; dirt that have stirred up, in the same way this concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, when developed &amp; pursued, is both peaceful &amp; exquisite, a refreshing &amp; pleasant abiding that immediately disperses &amp; allays any evil, unskillful (mental) qualities that have arisen.</p>

<p>"And how is concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing developed &amp; pursued so as to be both peaceful &amp; exquisite, a refreshing &amp; pleasant abiding that immediately disperses &amp; allays any evil, unskillful (mental) qualities that have arisen?</p>

<p> "There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>

<p>"[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.'... [16] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.'</p>

<p>"This is how concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is developed &amp; pursued so as to be both peaceful &amp; exquisite, a refreshing &amp; pleasant abiding that immediately disperses &amp; allays any evil, unskillful (mental) qualities that have arisen."</p>

<p><a id="passage_39"><b>&sect;39.</b></a> I have heard that on one occasion Ven. Sariputta was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Sanctuary. There he said to the monks, "This Unbinding is pleasant, friends. This Unbinding is pleasant."</p>

<p>When this was said, Ven. Udayin said to Ven. Sariputta, "But what is the pleasure here, my friend, where there is nothing felt?"</p>

<p>"Just that is the pleasure here, my friend: where there is nothing felt. There are these five strands of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing; sounds cognizable via the ear... aromas cognizable via the nose... flavors cognizable via the tongue... tactile sensations cognizable via the body &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. Whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality, that is sensual pleasure.</p>

<p>"Now there is the case where a monk &mdash; quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.

Just as pain arises as an affliction in a healthy person for his affliction, even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an affliction for him. Now, the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stress. So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant.</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with <i>directed thought,</i> that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the fading of rapture, remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, senses pleasure with the body, and enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' If, as he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with <i>rapture,</i> that is an affliction for him...</p>

<p>"Then there is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; stress &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of joys &amp; distresses &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain.

But if, on reflecting, he realizes that there are no evil, unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die during the day, then for that very reason he should dwell in joy &amp; rapture, training himself day &amp; night in skillful qualities.</p>

<p>"This, monks, is how mindfulness of death is developed &amp; pursued so that it is of great fruit &amp; great benefit, gains a footing in the deathless, and has the deathless as its final end."</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<p><a id="passage_44"><b>&sect;44.</b></a> Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat down to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him: "Well now, your majesty, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"</p>

<p>"Just now, lord, I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of head-anointed noble-warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty, obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures, who have attained stable control in their country, and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth."</p>

<p>"What do you think, your majesty? Suppose a man, trustworthy and reliable, were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say: 'If it please your majesty, you should know that I come from the east. There I saw a great mountain, as high as the clouds, coming this way, crushing all living beings [in its path]. Do whatever you think should be done.' Then a second man were to come to you from the west... Then a third man were to come to you from the north... Then a fourth man were to come to you from the south and on arrival would say: 'If it please your majesty, you should know that I come from the south. There I saw a great mountain, as high as the clouds, coming this way, crushing all living beings. Do whatever you think should be done.' If, your majesty, such a great peril should arise, such a terrible destruction of human life &mdash; the human state being so hard to obtain &mdash; what should be done?"</p>

<p>"If, lord, such a great peril should arise, such a terrible destruction of human life &mdash; the human state being so hard to obtain &mdash; what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious deeds?"</p>

<p>"I inform you, your majesty, I announce to you, your majesty: aging and death are rolling in on you. When aging and death are rolling in on you, great king, what should be done?"</p>

<p>"As aging and death are rolling in on me, lord, what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious deeds?</p>

<p>"There are, lord, elephant battles (fought by) head-anointed noble-warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty, obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures, who have attained stable control in their country, and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth; but there is no use for those elephant battles, no scope for them, when aging and death are rolling in. There are cavalry battles... chariot battles... infantry battles... but there is no use for those infantry battles, no scope for them, when aging and death are rolling in. In this royal court there are counselors who, when the enemies arrive, are capable of dividing them by their wits; but there is no use for those battles of wits, no scope for them, when aging and death are rolling in. In this royal court there is abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and depositories, and with such wealth we are capable of buying off enemies when they come; but there is no use for those battles of wealth, no scope for them, when aging and death are rolling in. As aging and death are rolling in on me, venerable sir, what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious deeds?"</p>

<p>"So it is, your majesty! So it is, your majesty! As aging and death are rolling in on you, what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious deeds?"</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

<div class="freeverse">
"Like massive boulders,
mountains pressing against the sky,
moving in from all sides,
crushing the four directions,
	so aging and death
come rolling over living beings:
noble warriors, brahmans, merchants,
workers, outcastes, &amp; scavengers.

They spare nothing.
They trample everything.
Here elephant troops can hold no ground,
nor can chariots or infantry,
nor can a battle of wits
or wealth win out.

So a wise person,
seeing his own good,
steadfast, secures confidence
in the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha.

One who practices the Dhamma
in thought, word, &amp; deed,
receives praise here on earth
and after death rejoices in heaven."

<h1><a id='body'>6. Mindfulness Immersed in the Body</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>

<div class='excerpt'>
<p><a id="passage_49"><b>&sect;49.</b></a> "Now, how is mindfulness immersed in the body developed, how is it pursued, so as to be of great fruit &amp; great benefit?</p>

<p>"There is the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>

<p>"Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' And as he remains thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, any memories &amp; resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning his mind gathers &amp; settles inwardly, grows unified &amp; centered. This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, when walking, the monk discerns, 'I am walking.' When standing, he discerns, 'I am standing.' When sitting, he discerns, 'I am sitting.' When lying down, he discerns, 'I am lying down.' Or however his body is disposed, that is how he discerns it... This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, when going forward &amp; returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward &amp; looking away... when bending &amp; extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe &amp; his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, &amp; savoring... when urinating &amp; defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, &amp; remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert... This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p> "Furthermore... just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain &mdash; wheat, rice, mung beans, kidney beans, sesame seeds, husked rice &mdash; and a man with good eyesight, pouring it out, were to reflect, 'This is wheat. This is rice. These are mung beans. These are kidney beans. These are sesame seeds. This is husked rice'; in the same way, the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on down, surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things: 'In this body there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, gorge, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva, mucus, fluid in the joints, urine'... This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"Furthermore... just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces, the monk contemplates this very body &mdash; however it stands, however it is disposed &mdash; in terms of properties: 'In this body there is the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, &amp; the wind property'... This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground &mdash; one day, two days, three days dead &mdash; bloated, livid, &amp; festering, he applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate'...</p>

<p>"Or again, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground, picked at by crows, vultures, &amp; hawks, by dogs, hyenas, &amp; various other creatures... a skeleton smeared with flesh &amp; blood, connected with tendons... a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, connected with tendons... a skeleton without flesh or blood, connected with tendons... bones detached from their tendons, scattered in all directions &mdash; here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a hip bone, there a back bone, here a rib, there a chest bone, here a shoulder bone, there a neck bone, here a jaw bone, there a tooth, here a skull... the bones whitened, somewhat like the color of shells... piled up, more than a year old... decomposed into a powder: He applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate.'</p>

<p>"And as he remains thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, any memories &amp; resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning his mind gathers &amp; settles inwardly, grows unified &amp; centered. This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<h4>The Four Jhanas</h4>

<p>"Furthermore, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion. Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again &amp; again with water, so that his ball of bath powder &mdash; saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within &amp; without &mdash; would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion. And as he remains thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, any memories &amp; resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning his mind gathers &amp; settles inwardly, grows unified &amp; centered. This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"And furthermore, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies supplying abundant showers time &amp; again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate &amp; pervade, suffuse &amp; fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. And as he remains thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, any memories &amp; resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning his mind gathers &amp; settles inwardly, grows unified &amp; centered. This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a lotus pond, some of the lotuses, born &amp; growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated &amp; pervaded, suffused &amp; filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. And as he remains thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, any memories &amp; resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning his mind gathers &amp; settles inwardly, grows unified &amp; centered. This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of joys &amp; distresses &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness. And as he remains thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, any memories &amp; resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning his mind gathers &amp; settles inwardly, grows unified &amp; centered. This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<h4>Fullness of Mind</h4>

<p>"Monks, whoever develops &amp; pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing. Just as whoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the ocean, in the same way, whoever develops &amp; pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing.</p>

<p>"In whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed, not pursued, Mara gains entry, Mara gains a foothold.</p>

<p>"Suppose that a man were to throw a heavy stone ball into a pile of wet clay. What do you think, monks &mdash; would that heavy stone ball gain entry into the pile of wet clay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"In the same way, in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed, not pursued, Mara gains entry, Mara gains a foothold.</p>

<p>"Now, suppose that there were a dry, sapless piece of timber, and a man were to come along with an upper fire-stick, thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.' What do you think &mdash; would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper fire-stick in the dry, sapless piece of timber?"</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"In the same way, in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed, not pursued, Mara gains entry, Mara gains a foothold.</p>

<p>"Now, suppose that there were an empty, hollow water-pot set on a stand, and a man were to come along carrying a load of water. What do you think &mdash; would he get a place to pour out his water?"</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"In the same way, in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed, not pursued, Mara gains entry, Mara gains a foothold.</p>

<p>"Now, in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is developed, is pursued, Mara gains no entry, Mara gains no foothold. Suppose that a man were to throw a ball of string against a door panel made entirely of heartwood. What do you think &mdash; would that light ball of string gain entry into the door panel made entirely of heartwood?"</p>

<p>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"In the same way, in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is developed, is pursued, Mara gains no entry, Mara gains no foothold.</p>

<p>"Now, suppose that there were a wet, sappy piece of timber, and a man were to come along with an upper fire-stick, thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.' What do you think &mdash; would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper fire-stick in the wet, sappy piece of timber?"</p>

<p>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"In the same way, in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is developed, is pursued, Mara gains no entry, Mara gains no foothold.</p>

<p>"Now, suppose that there were an water-pot set on a stand, full of water up to the brim so that crows could drink out of it, and a man were to come along carrying a load of water. What do you think &mdash; would he get a place to pour out his water?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"In the same way, in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is developed, is pursued, Mara gains no entry, Mara gains no foothold.</p>

<h4>An Opening to the Higher Knowledges</h4>

<p>"When anyone has developed &amp; pursued mindfulness immersed in the body, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>

<p>"Suppose that there were a water jar, set on a stand, brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it. If a strong man were to tip it in any way at all, would water spill out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord."</p>

<p>"In the same way, when anyone has developed &amp; pursued mindfulness immersed in the body, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>

<p>"Suppose there were a rectangular water tank &mdash; set on level ground, bounded by dikes &mdash; brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it. If a strong man were to loosen the dikes anywhere at all, would water spill out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord."</p>

<p>"In the same way, when anyone has developed &amp; pursued mindfulness immersed in the body, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>

<p>"Suppose there were a chariot on level ground at four crossroads, harnessed to thoroughbreds, waiting with whips lying ready, so that a skilled driver, a trainer of tamable horses, might mount and &mdash; taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right &mdash; drive out and back, to whatever place and by whichever road he liked; in the same way, anyone has developed &amp; pursued mindfulness immersed in the body, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>

<h4>Ten Benefits</h4>

<p>"Monks, for one in whom mindfulness immersed in the body is cultivated, developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken, ten benefits can be expected. Which ten?</p>

<p>[1] "He conquers displeasure &amp; delight, and displeasure does not conquer him. He remains victorious over any displeasure that has arisen.</p>

<p>[2] "He conquers fear &amp; dread, and fear &amp; dread to not conquer him. He remains victorious over any fear &amp; dread that have arisen.</p>

<p>[3] "He is resistant to cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of gadflies &amp; mosquitoes, wind &amp; sun &amp; creeping things; to abusive, hurtful language; he is the sort that can endure bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, sharp, stabbing, fierce, distasteful, disagreeable, deadly.</p>

<p>[4] "He can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas &mdash; heightened mental states providing a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now.</p>

<p>[5] "He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>

<p>[6] "He hears &mdash; by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far.</p>

<p>[7] "He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not an the most excellent level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a centered mind as a centered mind, and an uncentered mind as an uncentered mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind.</p>

<p>[8] "He recollects his manifold past lives <i>[literally,</i> previous homes], i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, (recollecting,) 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and details.</p>

<p>[9] "He sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings &mdash; who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings &mdash; who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.</p>

<p>[10] "Through the ending of the fermentations, he remains in the fermentation-free release of awareness and release of discernment, having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now.</p>

<p>"Monks, for one in whom mindfulness immersed in the body is cultivated, developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken, these ten benefits can be expected."</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<div class="freeverse">
Whether walking, standing,
sitting, or lying down,
it flexes &amp; stretches:
	this is the body's movement.
Joined together with tendons &amp; bones,
plastered over with muscle &amp; skin,
hidden by complexion,
	the body isn't seen
	for what it is:
filled with intestines, filled with stomach,
with the lump of the liver,
bladder, lungs, heart,
kidneys, spleen,
mucus, sweat, saliva, fat,
blood, synovial fluid, bile, &amp; oil.
On top of that,
in nine streams,
filth is always flowing from it:
from the eyes : eye secretions,
from the ears : ear secretions,
from the nose : mucus,
from the mouth : now vomit,
	now phlegm,
	now bile.
from the body : beads of sweat.
And on top of that,
its hollow head is filled with brains.

The fool, beset by ignorance,
thinks it beautiful.
but when it lies dead,
	swollen, livid,
	cast away in a charnel ground,
even relatives don't care for it.
Dogs feed on it,
jackals, wolves, &amp; worms.
Crows &amp; vultures feed on it,
along with any other animals there.

Having heard the Awakened One's words,
the discerning monk
comprehends, for he sees it
	for what it is:
"As this is, so is that.
As that, so this."
Within &amp; without,
he should let desire for the body
	fade away.
With desire &amp; passion faded away,
the discerning monk arrives here:
	at the deathless,
	the calm,
	the undying state
	of Unbinding.
	
This two-footed, filthy, evil-smelling,
filled-with-various-carcasses,
oozing-out-here-&amp;-there body:
Whoever would think,
on the basis of a body like this,
to exalt himself or disparage another:
	What is that

<p><a id="passage_51"><b>&sect;51.</b></a> "I will teach you a Dhamma discourse on bondage &amp; lack of bondage. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

<p>The Blessed One said: "A woman attends inwardly to her feminine faculties, her feminine gestures, her feminine manners, feminine poise, feminine desires, feminine voice, feminine charms. She is excited by that, delighted by that. Being excited &amp; delighted by that, she attends outwardly to masculine faculties, masculine gestures, masculine manners, masculine poise, masculine desires, masculine voices, masculine charms. She is excited by that, delighted by that. Being excited &amp; delighted by that, she wants to be bonded to what is outside her, wants whatever pleasure &amp; happiness that arise based on that bond. Delighting, caught up in her femininity, a woman goes into bondage with reference to men. This is how a woman does not transcend her femininity.</p>

<p>"A man attends inwardly to his masculine faculties, masculine gestures, masculine manners, masculine poise, masculine desires, masculine voice, masculine charms. He is excited by that, delighted by that. Being excited &amp; delighted by that, he attends outwardly to feminine faculties, feminine gestures, feminine manners, feminine poise, feminine desires, feminine voices, feminine charms. He is excited by that, delighted by that. Being excited &amp; delighted by that, he wants to be bonded to what is outside him, wants whatever pleasure &amp; happiness that arise based on that bond. Delighting, caught up in his masculinity, a man goes into bondage with reference to women. This is how a man does not transcend his masculinity.</p>

<p>"And how is there lack of bondage? A woman does not attend inwardly to her feminine faculties... feminine charms. She is not excited by that, not delighted by that... does not attend outwardly to masculine faculties... masculine charms. She is not excited by that, not delighted by that... does not want to be bonded to what is outside her, does not want whatever pleasure &amp; happiness that arise based on that bond. Not delighting, not caught up in her femininity, a woman does not go into bondage with reference to men. This is how a woman transcends her femininity.</p>

<p>"A man does not attend inwardly to his masculine faculties... masculine charms. He is not excited by that, not delighted by that... does not attend outwardly to feminine faculties... feminine charms.

Not delighting, not caught up in his masculinity, a man does not go into bondage with reference to women. This is how a man transcends his masculinity.</p>

<p>"This is how there is lack of bondage. And this is the Dhamma discourse on bondage &amp; lack of bondage."</p>

<p><a id="passage_52"><b>&sect;52.</b></a> The Blessed One said, "Suppose, monks, that a large crowd of people comes thronging together, saying, 'The beauty queen! The beauty queen!' And suppose that the beauty queen is highly accomplished at singing &amp; dancing, so that an even greater crowd comes thronging, saying, 'The beauty queen is singing! The beauty queen is dancing!' Then a man comes along, desiring life &amp; shrinking from death, desiring pleasure &amp; abhorring pain. They say to him, 'Now look here, mister. You must take this bowl filled to the brim with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd &amp; the beauty queen. A man with a raised sword will follow right behind you, and wherever you spill even a drop of oil, right there will he cut off your head.' Now what do you think, monks: Will that man, not paying attention to the bowl of oil, let himself get distracted outside?"</p>

<p>"No, lord."</p>

<p>"I have given you this parable to convey a meaning. The meaning is this: The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the body. Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body. We will pursue it, give it a means of transport, give it a grounding, steady it, consolidate it, and undertake it well.' That is how you should train yourselves."</p>

<p> <a id="passage_53"><b>&sect;53.</b></a> "And what is lack of restraint? There is the case where a monk, seeing a form with the eye, is set on pleasing forms, is repelled by unpleasing forms, and remains with body-mindfulness unestablished, with limited awareness. He does not discern, as it has come to be, the awareness-release, the discernment-release, where any evil, unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder.</p>

<p>"Hearing a sound with the ear...</p>

<p>"Smelling an aroma with the nose...</p>

<p>"Tasting a flavor with the tongue...</p>

<p>"Touching a tactile sensation with the body...</p>

<p>"Cognizing an idea with the intellect, he is set on pleasing ideas, is repelled by unpleasing ideas, and remains with body-mindfulness unestablished, with limited awareness. He does not discern, as it has come to be, the awareness-release, the discernment-release, where any evil, unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder.</p>

<p>"Just as if a person, catching six animals of different ranges, of different habitats, were to bind them with a strong rope. Catching a snake, he would bind it with a strong rope. Catching a crocodile... a bird... a dog... a hyena... a monkey, he would bind it with a strong rope. Binding them all with a strong rope, and tying a knot in the middle, he would set chase to them.</p>

<p>"Then those six animals, of different ranges, of different habitats, would each pull toward its own range &amp; habitat. The snake would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the anthill.' The crocodile would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the water.' The bird would pull, thinking, 'I'll fly up into the air.' The dog would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the village.' The hyena would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the charnel ground.' The monkey would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the forest.' And when these six animals became internally exhausted, they would submit, they would surrender, they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongest. In the same way, when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped &amp; unpursued, the eye pulls toward pleasing forms, while unpleasing forms are repellent. The ear pulls toward pleasing sounds... The nose pulls toward pleasing aromas... The tongue pulls toward pleasing flavors... The body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensations... The intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas, while unpleasing ideas are repellent. This, monks, is lack of restraint.</p>

<p>"And what is restraint? There is the case where a monk, seeing a form with the eye, is not set on pleasing forms, is not repelled by unpleasing forms, and remains with body-mindfulness established, with immeasurable awareness. He discerns, as it has come to be, the awareness-release, the discernment-release, where all evil, unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder.</p>

Catching a crocodile... a bird... a dog... a hyena... a monkey, he would bind it with a strong rope. Binding them all with a strong rope, he would tether them to a strong post or stake.</p>

<p>"Then those six animals, of different ranges, of different habitats, would each pull toward its own range &amp; habitat. The snake would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the anthill.' The crocodile would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the water.' The bird would pull, thinking, 'I'll fly up into the air.' The dog would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the village.' The hyena would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the charnel ground.' The monkey would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the forest.' And when these six animals became internally exhausted, they would stand, sit, or lie down right there next to the post or stake. In the same way, when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed &amp; pursued, the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms, and unpleasing forms are not repellent. The ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds... The nose does not pull toward pleasing aromas... The tongue does not pull toward pleasing flavors... The body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensations... The intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas, and unpleasing ideas are not repellent. This, monks, is restraint.</p>

<p>"The 'strong post or stake' is a term for mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

<p>"Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body. We will pursue it, give it a means of transport, give it a grounding. We will steady it, consolidate it, and set about it properly.' That is how you should train yourselves."</p>

There is the case where a monk, secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form, feeling, perception, fabrications, &amp; consciousness, as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, an emptiness, not-self. He turns his mind away from those phenomena, and having done so, inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness: 'This is peace, this is exquisite &mdash; the resolution of all fabrications; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding.'</p>
