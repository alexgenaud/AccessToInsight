<h1><a id='intro'>Introduction</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>The doctrine of kamma (karma &mdash; action) is one of the Buddha's central teachings. There is a modern myth that he simply picked up his ideas on kamma from the worldview prevalent in his day, and that they aren't really integral to his message. Nothing could be further from the truth. Early Buddhists often cited the Buddha's teaching on kamma as one of the prime teachings that set him apart from his contemporaries, and a study of his teachings on kamma will show that they underlie everything else he taught.</p>
<p>The following readings from the Pali canon are designed to give an overview of the Buddha's teachings on kamma. Before tackling them, you might want to read a few introductory articles on the topic, including the following ones available on Access to Insight: "<a href="../authors/thanissaro/karma.html">Karma</a>," "<a href="../authors/thanissaro/refuge.html#act">A Refuge in Skillful Action</a>" (contained in the book, <i><a href="../authors/thanissaro/refuge.html">Refuge</a>),</i> and "<a href="../authors/thanissaro/resonance.html">Samsara Divided by Zero</a>."</p>
<p>The readings here are divided into three main sections:</p>
<ol class='nonSemantic-listi'>
<li><a href="#nonbuddhist">Non-Buddhist theories</a></li>
<li><a href="#skillfulness">Skillfulness</a></li>
<li><a href="#kamma">Kamma</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first section provides background for the Buddhist teachings on kamma by showing how the early Buddhists viewed the way other contemporary schools of thought explained kamma.</p>
<p>The second section focuses on the Buddha's basic observation that underlay his teachings on kamma: that it is possible to develop a skill. This simple fact carries a number of important implications for any teaching on action. (1) Actions give results, and their results follow a discernible pattern. Otherwise, it would not be possible to develop a skill. (2) Some results are more desirable than others. Otherwise, there would be no point in developing a skill. (3) By observing one's mistakes one may learn from them and use that knowledge to act more skillfully in the future. This means that the mind is a crucial agent in determining actions and their results, and there is an opening for feedback to influence the process of action. It is thus a non-linear process, and there is room for free will. (4) Results can be observed while one is acting, as well as after the action is done. This means that actions have both immediate results and long-term results, a fact that makes the non-linear process very complex.</p>
<p>The passages in the second section discuss how these observations apply in practice. <a href="#passage-5">&sect;5</a> discusses how the Buddha applied the principle of skillfulness to reach Awakening. <a href="#passage-7">&sect;7</a> shows how to use it to decide what teachings are valid. <a href="#passage-8">&sect;8</a> discusses how to apply it to all of one's actions. The remaining passages are self-explanatory.</p>
<p>The third section, on kamma, consists of passages that build a larger theory of action based on these observations. These passages are divided into three sub-sections, based on a classification given in <a href="#passage-14">&sect;14</a>:</p>
<ol class='nonSemantic-listA'>
<li><a href="#causes">Kamma &amp; Causes</a></li>
<li><a href="#results">Results</a></li>
<li><a href="#diversity">Diversity &amp; Cessation</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Sub-section A is the most theoretical part of this study guide. It covers the Buddha's basic theory of causation (&sect;15) and treats the place of intention &mdash; the factor that the Buddha identified as the essence of kamma &mdash; in the context of the Buddha's analysis of physical and mental phenomena (name-&amp;-form). In the light of the Buddha's observation in <a href="#passage-5">&sect;5</a> that views influence kamma (views come under attention in the analysis of "name"), this sub-section concludes with two levels of right view: mundane right view, which informs the sort of good kamma that brings about happy results within the process of death and rebirth; and transcendent right view, which informs the sort of kamma that brings freedom from that process.</p>
<p>Sub-section B focuses on the issue of how long it takes for the results of kamma to appear, and gives particular attention to some of the complexities that arise from the fact that kamma is non-linear. Sometimes the results of an action don't appear immediately, or even in the immediate next life. <a href="#passage-27">&sect;27</a> discusses the role that the mind plays in determining how the results of kamma are experienced, and <a href="#passage-28">&sect;28</a> treats the intelligent way to use the Buddha's teachings on kamma when reflecting on one's own past bad kamma so as to train oneself in the proper frame of mind.</p>
<p>Sub-section C is divided into two further sub-sections, based on a classification in <a href="#passage-29">&sect;29</a>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="#bandw">Dark Kamma, Bright Kamma</a></li>
<li><a href="#notbnotw">Kamma Neither Dark nor Bright</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these two sub-sections discusses types of actions and mental qualities that lead to good or bad results within the process of rebirth and death. In some passages the emphasis is on results in the present life; in others, on results in future lives. The second of these two sub-sections discusses the type of kamma &mdash; and the right views underlying that kamma &mdash; leading to freedom: the cessation of kamma, the realization of nibbana. The concluding passages make the point that transcendent right view contains the seeds for its own transcendence: once it has done its duty in cutting away other attachments, it creates the momentum so that the mind can then abandon attachment to views of any sort, right or wrong, mundane or transcendent. That is how true freedom is gained.</p>

<p>"There are brahmans &amp; contemplatives who hold this teaching, hold this view: 'Whatever a person experiences &mdash; pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful &mdash; that is all caused by what was done in the past.'

Thus asked by me, they admitted, 'Yes.' Then I said to them, 'Then in that case, a person is a killer of living beings because of what was done in the past. A person is a thief... unchaste... a liar... a divisive speaker... an abusive speaker... an idle chatterer... covetous... malevolent... a holder of wrong views because of what was done in the past.' When one falls back on what was done in the past as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't pin down as a truth or reality what should &amp; shouldn't be done, one dwells bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative...</p>

<p><b><a id="passage-2">&sect; 2.</a></b> King Ajatasattu: "Purana Kassapa said to me, 'Great king, in acting or getting others to act, in mutilating or getting others to mutilate, in torturing or getting others to torture, in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow, in tormenting or getting others to torment, in intimidating or getting others to intimidate, in taking life, taking what is not given, breaking into houses, plundering wealth, committing burglary, ambushing highways, committing adultery, speaking lies &mdash; one does no evil. If with a razor-edged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh, a single pile of flesh, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges, killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting others to mutilate, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges, killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting others to mutilate, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Through generosity, self-control, restraint, and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause, no coming of merit'...</p>
<p>"Ajita Kesakambalin said to me, 'Great king, there is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no brahmans or contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves. A person is a composite of four primary elements. At death, the earth (in the body) returns to and merges with the (external) earth-substance. The fire returns to and merges with the external fire-substance. The liquid returns to and merges with the external liquid-substance. The wind returns to and merges with the external wind-substance. The sense-faculties scatter into space. Four men, with the bier as the fifth, carry the corpse. Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground. The bones turn pigeon-colored. The offerings end in ashes. Generosity is taught by idiots. The words of those who speak of existence after death are false, empty chatter. With the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death'...</p>
<p>"Pakudha Kaccayana said to me, 'Great king, there are these seven substances &mdash; unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar &mdash; that do not alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, are incapable of causing one another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain. Which seven? The earth-substance, the liquid-substance, the fire-substance, the wind-substance, pleasure, pain, and the soul as the seventh. These are the seven substances... And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing, no hearer nor one who causes hearing, no cognizer nor one who causes cognition. When one cuts off [another person's] head, there is no one taking anyone's life. It is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes.'"</p>

<a id="passage-3">&sect; 3.</a></b> "There are, monks, some contemplatives &amp; brahmans who, being asked questions regarding this or that, resort to verbal contortions, to eel-like wriggling, on four grounds... There is the case of a certain brahman or contemplative who does not discern as it actually is that 'This is skillful,' or that 'This is unskillful.' The thought occurs to him: 'I don't discern as it actually is that "This is skillful," or that "This is unskillful." If I... were to declare that "This is skillful," or that "This is unskillful," desire, passion, aversion, or resistance would occur to me; that would be a falsehood for me. Whatever would be a falsehood for me would be a distress for me. Whatever would be a distress for me would be an obstacle for me.' So, out of fear of falsehood, a loathing for falsehood, he does not declare that 'This is skillful,' or that 'This is unskillful.' Being asked questions regarding this or that, he resorts to verbal contortions, to eel-like wriggling: 'I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not.

They might cross-question me, press me for reasons, rebuke me. I might not be able to stand my ground, that would be a distress for me... an obstacle for me.' So, out of a fear for questioning, a loathing for questioning... he resorts to verbal contortions, to eel-like wriggling...</p>

Out of dullness &amp; exceeding stupidity, he &mdash; being asked questions regarding this or that &mdash; resorts to verbal contortions, to eel-like wriggling: 'If you ask me if there exists another world [after death], if I thought that there exists another world, would I declare that to you?

<p><b><a id="passage-5">&sect; 5.</a></b> "Before my self-awakening, when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta, the thought occurred to me: 'Why don't I keep dividing my thinking into two classes?' So I made thinking imbued with sensuality, thinking imbued with malevolence, &amp; thinking imbued with harmfulness one class, and thinking imbued with renunciation, thinking imbued with non-malevolence, &amp; thinking imbued with harmlessness another class.</p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking imbued with sensuality arose in me. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me; and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both. It obstructs discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not lead to Unbinding.'</p>
<p>"As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction, it subsided. As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others... to the affliction of both... it obstructs discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not lead to Unbinding, it subsided. Whenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen, I simply abandoned it, destroyed it, dispelled it, wiped it out of existence. (Similarly with thinking imbued with malevolence &amp; harmfulness.)</p>
<p>"Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking &amp; pondering, that becomes the inclination of his awareness. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality, abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with sensuality. (Similarly with thinking imbued with malevolence &amp; harmfulness.)</p>
<p>"Just as in the last month of the Rains, in the autumn season when the crops are ripening, a cowherd would look after his cows: He would tap &amp; poke &amp; check &amp; curb them with a stick on this side &amp; that. Why is that? Because he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from that [if he let his cows wander into the crops]. In the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks, degradation, &amp; defilement, and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation &amp; promoting cleansing.</p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking imbued with renunciation arose in me. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in me; and that leads neither to my own affliction, nor to the affliction of others, nor to the affliction of both. It fosters discernment, promotes lack of vexation, &amp; leads to Unbinding. If I were to think &amp; ponder in line with that even for a night... even for a day... even for a day &amp; night, I do not envision any danger that would come from it, except that thinking &amp; pondering a long time would tire the body. When the body is tired, the mind is disturbed; and a disturbed mind is far from concentration.' So I steadied my mind right within, settled, unified, &amp; concentrated it. Why is that? So that my mind would not be disturbed. (Similarly with thinking imbued with non-malevolence &amp; harmlessness.)</p>
<p>"Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking &amp; pondering, that becomes the inclination of his awareness. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation, abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciation. (Similarly with thinking imbued with non-malevolence &amp; harmlessness.)</p>
<p>"Just as in the last month of the hot season, when all the crops have been gathered into the village, a cowherd would look after his cows: While resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open, he simply keeps himself mindful of 'those cows.' In the same way, I simply kept myself mindful of 'those mental qualities.'</p>
<p>"Unflagging persistence was aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness established. My body was calm &amp; unaroused, my mind concentrated &amp; single. Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, I entered &amp; remained in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, I entered &amp; remained in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and physically sensitive of pleasure. I entered &amp; remained in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; I entered &amp; remained in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of recollecting my past lives.</i> I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes &amp; details.</p>
<p>"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute.</p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated... &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of the passing away &amp; reappearance of beings.</i> I saw &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings &mdash; who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech &amp; mind, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings &mdash; who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who did not revile the Noble Ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; I saw beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.</p>
<p>"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute.</p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations.</i> I discerned, as it had come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>
<p>"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute."</p>

<a id="passage-7">&sect; 7.</a></b> As they were sitting to one side, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One, "Lord, there are some brahmans &amp; contemplatives who come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. And then other brahmans &amp; contemplatives come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. They leave us simply uncertain &amp; doubtful: Which of these venerable brahmans &amp; contemplatives are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?"</p>
<p>"Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are doubtful. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering' &mdash; then you should abandon them...</p>
<p>"What do you think, Kalamas: when greed arises in a person, does it arise for benefit or for harm?"</p>
<p>"For harm, lord."</p>
<p>"And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed by greed: doesn't he kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, and induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord."</p>
<p>(Similarly for aversion &amp; delusion.)</p>
<p>So what do you think, Kalamas: are these qualities skillful or unskillful?"</p>

<p>"Blameworthy or blameless?"</p>
<p>"Blameworthy, lord."</p>
<p>"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?"</p>
<p>"Criticized by the wise, lord."</p>
<p>"When adopted &amp; carried out, do they lead to harm &amp; suffering, or not?"</p>

<p><i>The Buddha:</i> "What do you think, Rahula: What is a mirror for?"</p>
<p><i>Rahula:</i> "For reflection, sir."</p>
<p><i>The Buddha:</i> "In the same way, Rahula, bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection.</p>
<p>"Whenever you want to perform a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I want to perform &mdash; would it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do. (Similarly with verbal acts &amp; mental acts.)</p>
<p>"While you are performing a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I am doing &mdash; is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to affliction of others, or both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it. (Similarly with verbal acts &amp; mental acts.)</p>
<p>"Having performed a bodily act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should confess it, reveal it, lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life. Having confessed it... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed &amp; joyful, training day &amp; night in skillful mental qualities. (Similarly with verbal acts.)</p>
<p>"Having performed a mental act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should feel horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted with it. Feeling horrified... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed &amp; joyful, training day &amp; night in skillful mental qualities.</p>
<p>"Rahula, all the brahmans &amp; contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"All the brahmans &amp; contemplatives in the course of the future... All the brahmans &amp; contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts, do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, &amp; mental acts in just this way.</p>
<p>"So, Rahula, you should train yourself: 'I will purify my bodily acts... verbal acts... my mental acts through repeated reflection.' That's how you should train yourself."</p>

<a id="passage-10">&sect; 10.</a></b> "Now, Cunda, there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action, four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action, and three ways in which one is made pure by mental action.</p>
<p>"And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning the taking of life, <i>abstains from taking life.</i> He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the benefit of all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he <i>abstains from taking what is not given.</i> He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them. Abandoning illicit sex, he <i>abstains from illicit sex.</i> He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man. This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action.</p>
<p>"And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning false speech, <i>abstains from false speech.</i> When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering of his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty, if he is asked as a witness, 'Come &amp; tell, good man, what you know': If he doesn't know, he says, 'I don't know.' If he does know, he says, 'I know.' If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward. Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. Abandoning divisive speech, he <i>abstains from divisive speech.</i> What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. Abandoning abusive speech, he <i>abstains from abusive speech.</i> He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing &amp; pleasing to people at large. Abandoning idle chatter, he <i>abstains from idle chatter.</i> He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, &amp; the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action.</p>
<p>"And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action? There is the case where a certain person <i>is not covetous.</i> He does not covet the belongings of others, thinking, 'O, that what belongs to others would be mine!' He <i>bears no malevolence</i> and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart. [He thinks,] 'May these beings be free from animosity, free from oppression, free from trouble, and may they look after themselves with ease!' He <i>has right view</i> and is not warped in the way he sees things: 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits &amp; results of good &amp; bad actions. There is this world &amp; the next world. There is mother &amp; father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are brahmans &amp; contemplatives who, faring rightly &amp; practicing rightly, proclaim this world &amp; the next after having directly known &amp; realized it for themselves.' This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action.</p>
<p>"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of skillful action. When a person is endowed with these ten courses of skillful action, then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth, he is still pure. If he doesn't touch the earth, he is still pure. If he touches wet cow dung, he is still pure. If he doesn't touch wet cow dung, he is still pure. If he touches green grass... If he doesn't touch green grass... If he worships a fire... If he doesn't worship a fire... If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands... If he doesn't pay homage to the sun with clasped hands... If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall... If he doesn't go down into the water three times by nightfall, he is still pure. Why is that? Because these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purity. Furthermore, as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action, [rebirth among] the devas is declared, [rebirth among] human beings is declared &mdash; that or any other good destination."</p>

As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him: "Headman, how does Nigantha Nataputta teach the Dhamma to his disciples?"</p>
<p>"Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way, lord: 'All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell. All those who steal... All those who indulge in illicit sex... All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell. Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led [to a state of rebirth].' That's how Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples."</p>

What do you think, headman: If a man is one who takes life, then taking into consideration time spent doing &amp; not doing, whether by day or by night, which time is more: the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life?"</p>
<p>"... the time he spends taking life is less, lord, and the time he spends not taking life is certainly more.

A disciple has faith in that teacher, and the thought occurs to him, 'Our teacher holds this doctrine, holds this view: "All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation, are destined for hell." There are living beings that I have killed. I, too, am destined for the plane of deprivation, am destined for hell.' He fastens onto that view.

But if I become remorseful for that reason, that evil deed of mine will not be undone.' So, reflecting thus, he abandons right then the taking of life, and in the future refrains from taking life.

Long life... beauty... pleasure... status... rebirth in heaven... Now, I tell you, these five things are not to be obtained through prayers or wishes. If they were to be obtained through prayers or wishes, who here would lack them? It's not fitting for the noble disciple who desires long life to pray for it or to delight in doing so. Instead, the noble disciple who desires long life should follow the path of practice leading to long life. In so doing, he will attain long life, either human or divine.

<a id="passage-33">&sect; 33.</a></b> "There are these four qualities, TigerPaw, that lead to a lay person's happiness &amp; well-being in this life. Which four? Being consummate in initiative, being consummate in vigilance, admirable friendship, and maintaining one's livelihood in tune.</p>
<p>"And what does it mean to be consummate in initiative? There is the case where a lay person, by whatever occupation he makes his living &mdash; whether by farming or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king's man or by any other craft &mdash; is clever &amp; untiring at it, endowed with discrimination in its techniques, enough to arrange &amp; carry it out. This is called being consummate in initiative.</p>
<p>"And what does it mean to be consummate in vigilance? There is the case when a lay person has righteous wealth &mdash; righteously gained, coming from his initiative, his striving, his making an effort, gathered by the strength of his arm, earned by his sweat &mdash; he manages to protect it through vigilance [with the thought], 'How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with this property of mine, nor fire burn it, nor water sweep it away, nor hateful heirs make off with it?' This is called being consummate in vigilance.</p>
<p>"And what is meant by admirable friendship? There is the case where a lay person, in whatever town or village he may dwell, spends time with householders or householders' sons, young or old, who are advanced in virtue. He talks with them, engages them in discussions. He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction, consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue, consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity, and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment. This is called admirable friendship.</p>
<p>"And what does it mean to maintain one's livelihood in tune? There is the case where a lay person, knowing the income and outflow of his wealth, maintains a livelihood in tune, neither a spendthrift nor a penny-pincher, [thinking], 'Thus will my income exceed my outflow, and my outflow will not exceed my income.' Just as when a weigher or his apprentice, when holding the scales, knows, 'It has tipped down so much or has tipped up so much,' in the same way, the lay person, knowing the income and outflow of his wealth, maintains a livelihood in tune, neither a spendthrift nor a penny-pincher, [thinking], 'Thus will my income exceed my outflow, and my outflow will not exceed my income.' If a lay person has a small income but maintains a grand livelihood, it will be rumored of him, 'This clansman devours his wealth like a fruit-tree eater [Commentary: one who shakes more fruit off a tree than he can possibly eat].' If a lay person has a large income but maintains a miserable livelihood, it will be rumored of him, 'This clansman will die of starvation.' But when a lay person, knowing the income and outflow of his wealth, maintains a livelihood in tune, neither a spendthrift nor a penny-pincher, [thinking], 'Thus will my income exceed my outflow, and my outflow will not exceed my income,' this is called maintaining one's livelihood in tune.</p>
<p>"These are the four drains on one's store of wealth: debauchery in sex; debauchery in drink; debauchery in gambling; and evil friendship, evil companionship, evil camaraderie. Just as if there were a great reservoir with four inlets and four drains, and a man were to close the inlets and open the drains, and the sky were not to pour down proper showers, the depletion of that great reservoir could be expected, not its increase. In the same way, these are the four drains on one's store of wealth: debauchery in sex; debauchery in drink; debauchery in gambling; and evil friendship, evil companionship, evil camaraderie.</p>
<p>"These are the four inlets to one's store of wealth: no debauchery in sex; no debauchery in drink; no debauchery in gambling; and admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie.

consorting with the wise,
paying homage to those worthy of homage:
	This is the highest protection.

Living in a civilized land,
having made merit in the past,
directing oneself rightly:
	This is the highest protection.

Broad knowledge, skill,

well-spoken words :
	This is the highest protection.

Support for one's parents,

Giving, living in rectitude,
assistance to one's relatives,
deeds that are blameless:

Avoiding, abstaining from evil;
refraining from intoxicants,
being heedful of the qualities of the mind:
	This is the highest protection.

Respect, humility,
contentment, gratitude,
hearing the Dhamma on timely occasions:
	This is the highest protection.

Patience, compliance,
seeing contemplatives,
discussing the Dhamma on timely occasions:
	This is the highest protection.

Austerity, celibacy,
seeing the Noble Truths,
realizing Unbinding:
	This is the highest protection.

A mind that, when touched
by the ways of the world,
is unshaken, sorrowless, dustless, secure:
	This is the highest protection.

Everywhere undefeated

people go everywhere in well-being:

<a id="passage-35">&sect; 35.</a></b> Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One: "The brahmans of the Western lands, lord &mdash; those who carry water pots, wear garlands of water plants, purify with water, &amp; worship fire &mdash; can take [the spirit of] a dead person, lift it out, instruct it, &amp; send it to heaven. But the Blessed One, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so that all the world, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter. Answer as you see fit...</p>
<p>"Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Rise up, O boulder! Come floating up, O boulder! Come float to the shore, O boulder!' What do you think: would that boulder &mdash; because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &mdash; rise up, come floating up, or come float to the shore?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"So it is with any man who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, abusive speech, &amp; idle chatter; is covetous, malevolent, &amp; holds to wrong views. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart &mdash; [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' &mdash; still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell...</p>
<p>"Now, suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break. There the shards &amp; jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would come up. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Sink, O ghee/oil! Submerge, O ghee/oil! Go down, O ghee/oil!' What do you think: would that ghee/oil, because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink, submerge, or go down?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"So it is with any man who refrains from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from indulging in illicit sex; he refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from abusive speech, &amp; from idle chatter; he is not covetous, not malevolent, &amp; holds to right view. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart &mdash; [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' &mdash; still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>

This being so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends [instead] to ideas unfit for attention...</p>
<p>"This is how he attends inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?'</p>
<p>"As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view <i>I have a self</i> arises in him as true &amp; established, or the view <i>I have no self</i> ... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self</i> ... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self</i> ... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self</i> arises in him as true &amp; established, or else he has a view like this: <i>This very self of mine &mdash; the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to the ripening of good &amp; bad actions &mdash; is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity.</i> This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, &amp; death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair.

<a id="passage-53">&sect; 53.</a></b> Now at that time this train of thought arose in the awareness of a certain monk: "It seems, then, that form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, fabrications are not-self, consciousness is not-self. So the actions done by what is not-self will touch what self? [What self will be touched by the actions done by what is not-self?]"</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having encompassed with his awareness the awareness of that monk, addressed the monks: "It's possible that a foolish man &mdash; his awareness immersed in ignorance &amp; governed by craving &mdash; might think that the Teacher's message can be slipped past in this way: 'It seems, then, that form is not-self, feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness is not-self. So what self will be touched by the actions done by what is not-self?' Haven't I counter-questioned &amp; trained you with regard to each of these phenomena? What do you think, monks: is form constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" "No, lord."</p>
<p>"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...</p>
<p>"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...</p>

"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" "No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.'</p>

<p>"Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.'

<a id="passage-59">&sect; 59.</a></b> Then Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were staying. On arrival he greeted them courteously. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the wanderers said to him, "Tell us, householder, what views Gotama the contemplative has.'</p>
<p>"Venerable sirs, I don't know entirely what views the Blessed One has."</p>
<p>"Well, well. So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has. Then tell us what views the monks have."</p>
<p>"I don't even know entirely what views the monks have."</p>
<p>"So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks have. Then tell us what views you have."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have. But please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position, and then it won't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have."</p>
<p>When this had been said, one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder, <i>"The cosmos is eternal.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have."</p>
<p>Another wanderer said to Anathapindika, <i>"The cosmos is not eternal.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have."</p>
<p>Another wanderer said, <i>"The cosmos is finite... The cosmos is infinite... The soul &amp; the body are the same... The soul is one thing and the body another... After death a Tathagata exists... After death a Tathagata does not exist... After death a Tathagata both does &amp; does not exist... After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have."</p>
<p>When this had been said, Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers, "As for the venerable one who says, <i>'The cosmos is eternal.</i> Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have,' his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another. Now this view has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen. Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress, submits himself to that very stress." (Similarly for the other positions.)</p>
<p>When this had been said, the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder, "We have each &amp; every one expounded to you in line with our own positions. Now tell us what views you have."</p>
<p>"Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not mine, is not what I am, is not my self. This is the sort of view I have."</p>
<p>"So, householder, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. You thus adhere to that very stress, submit yourself to that very stress."</p>
<p>"Venerable sirs, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not mine, is not what I am, is not my self. Having seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present, I also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is present."</p>
<p>When this had been said, the wanderers fell silent, abashed, sitting with their shoulders drooping, their heads down, brooding, at a loss for words. Anathapindika the householder, perceiving that the wanderers were silent, abashed... at a loss for words, got up &amp; left.</p>

<a id="passage-60">&sect; 60.</a></b> "This, monks, the Tathagata discerns. And he discerns that these standpoints, thus seized, thus held to, lead to such &amp; such a destination, to such &amp; such a state in the world beyond. And he discerns what surpasses this. And yet discerning that, he does not hold to that act of discernment. And as he is not holding to it, Unbinding <i>(nibbuti)</i> is experienced right within. Knowing, for what they are, the origin, ending, allure, &amp; drawbacks of feelings, along with the emancipation from feelings, the Tathagata, monks &mdash; through lack of clinging/sustenance &mdash; is released."</p>
