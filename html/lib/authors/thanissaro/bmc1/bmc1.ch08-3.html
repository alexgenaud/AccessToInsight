<p class="BMC_definition">
<a id="Pc21"><span class="BMC_num">21.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu, unauthorized, exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s, it is to be confessed.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
	<p>"Now at that time, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhun&#299;s became recipients of robes, alms, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. (According to the Commentary, if a bhikkhu gave a good exhortation to the bhikkhun&#299;s, they would tell their supporters, who in turn would provide the exhorter with requisites.) The thought occurred to some group-of-six bhikkhus: 'At present, elder bhikkhus exhorting the bhikkhun&#299;s have become recipients of robes, alms, lodgings, and medicines for the sick. Let's exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s, too.' So, having approached the bhikkhun&#299;s, they said, 'Come, sisters, go to us too, and we'll exhort you as well.'</p>

	<p>"So the bhikkhun&#299;s went to the group-of-six bhikkhus and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. Then the group-of-six bhikkhus, after giving just a trifling Dhamma talk and spending the day with animal talk, dismissed the bhikkhun&#299;s: 'You may go, sisters.'</p>

	<p>"Then the bhikkhun&#299;s went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed to him, stood to one side. As they were standing there, the Blessed One said to them: 'I hope the exhortation was effective, bhikkhun&#299;s.'</p>

	<p>"'Venerable sir, from where would the exhortation be effective? The group-of-six bhikkhus, giving just a trifling Dhamma talk, dismissed us after spending the day with animal talk.'"</p>
</div>

<p>When Mah&#257;paj&#257;pat&#299; Gotam&#299;, the Buddha's aunt and stepmother, asked him to establish an order of bhikkhun&#299;s, he did so on the condition that she and all future bhikkhun&#299;s accept eight rules of respect (<i>garu-dhamma</i>). (This term is sometimes translated as "heavy rules" or "important rules," but the Commentary explains it as meaning vows that the bhikkhun&#299;s are to accept with respect.) In short:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>1) Even a bhikkhun&#299; who has been ordained over a century must pay homage to a bhikkhu ordained that very day.</li>

	<li>2) A bhikkhun&#299; must not spend the Rains in a residence where there is no bhikkhu (within half a league, says the Commentary).</li>

	<li>3) Every half month a bhikkhun&#299; should expect two things from the Community of bhikkhus: the date of the P&#257;&#7789;imokkha recitation and permission to approach for an exhortation.</li>

	<li>4) At the end of the Rains-residence, every bhikkhun&#299; should invite accusations both from the Community of bhikkhun&#299;s and from the Community of bhikkhus.</li>

	<li>5) A bhikkhun&#299; who has broken any of the rules of respect must undergo penance (<i>m&#257;natta</i>) for half a month under both Communities.</li>

	<li>6) A woman may become ordained as a bhikkhun&#299; only after, as a female trainee (<i>sikkham&#257;n&#257;</i>), she has observed the first six precepts of the female novice without lapse for two full years. (According to the Bhikkhun&#299;s' P&#257;cittiyas 63, 66, and 72, she could do this with or without having also taken the full set of ten precepts of the female novice. However, simply having taken those ten precepts would not substitute for the need to receive authorization to hold stringently to the first six for two full years.)</li>

	<li>7) A bhikkhun&#299; is not to insult or revile a bhikkhu in any way. According to the Commentary, this means that she is not to insult him with any of the ten <i>akkosa-vatthu</i> (see <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc2">Pc 2</a>) or any other matter, nor is she to threaten him with harm.</li>
	</ul>




	<ul>
	<li>8) A bhikkhun&#299; may not instruct a bhikkhu, although a bhikkhu may instruct a bhikkhun&#299;. (According to the Commentary, this means that a bhikkhun&#299; may not give commands to a bhikkhu on how to behave. However, it notes, she may teach him in a more indirect manner, saying, for instance, "In the past, the great bhikkhus behaved like this.")</li>
	</ul>


<p>This rule deals with the biweekly exhortation mentioned in the third vow. The pattern for the exhortation was that once a bhikkhu had been chosen by the bhikkhus to exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s, he was to sweep the place for the exhortation within the monastery where he was dwelling, set out water for drinking and washing, arrange seats for the bhikkhun&#299;s, find a male companion, and then sit waiting for the bhikkhun&#299;s to arrive. When they had come, he was to ask if all the bhikkhun&#299;s were present and if the eight rules of respect were being kept up (&#167;). (According to the Commentary, this last question means, "Are they kept memorized so that they are fresh in the memory?") If they weren't, he was to recite the eight rules. If they were, he was to present an exhortation.</p>

<p>Because the eight rules form the heart of the exhortation, the two factors for the full offense under this rule are defined as follows:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><i>1) Object:</i> a bhikkhun&#299; or group of bhikkhun&#299;s.</li>

	<li><i>2) Effort:</i> A bhikkhu exhorts her/them concerning the eight rules of respect when he has neither been properly authorized to do so by the Community nor asked by the bhikkhun&#299;(s) to give instruction.</li>
	</ul>


<p><b>Object.</b> A bhikkhun&#299; had to undergo a double ordination, first in the Bhikkhun&#299; Sa&#7749;gha and then in the Bhikkhu Sa&#7749;gha, before she was considered fully ordained. Thus only a bhikkhun&#299; with the full double ordination is grounds for a p&#257;cittiya here. A bhikkhun&#299; who has received only her first ordination, from the Bhikkhun&#299; Sa&#7749;gha, is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a, while female trainees and female novices are not grounds for an offense.</p>

<p><b>Effort.</b> A bhikkhu, not properly authorized, who exhorts the bhikkhun&#299;s on any topic other than the eight rules incurs a dukka&#7789;a.</p>

<p><b>The authorization.</b> When this rule was still newly formulated, some group-of-six bhikkhus simply authorized one another to continue exhorting the bhikkhun&#299;s. This forced the Buddha to establish stringent standards for the type of bhikkhu who could properly be authorized. They were, in short:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>He is scrupulously virtuous.</li>

	<li>He is very learned and thoroughly understands the teachings of the celibate life.</li>

	<li>He has mastered both the bhikkhus' P&#257;&#7789;imokkha and the bhikkhun&#299;s' P&#257;&#7789;imokkha.</li>

	<li>He has a pleasing voice and delivery.</li>

	<li>He is well-liked by most of the bhikkhun&#299;s. (As the Commentary notes, this means that he is liked by the bhikkhun&#299;s who are learned, virtuous, and wise.)</li>

	<li>He is capable of exhorting the bhikkhun&#299;s. (This, according to the Commentary, means that he is able to cite sutta passages and other reasons that will instill within the bhikkhun&#299;s a sense of the dangers in the cycle of rebirth.)</li>

	<li>He never, before his ordination, violated an important rule against one wearing the ochre robe. (This, according to the Commentary, means that he never engaged in bodily contact with a bhikkhun&#299; or in sexual intercourse with a female trainee or female novice).</li>

	<li>He has been a bhikkhu for at least 20 years.</li>
	</ul>


<p>With regard to the first of these qualifications, Cv.II.1.2 notes that a bhikkhu undergoing penance or probation for a sa&#7749;gh&#257;disesa offense should not accept an authorization to exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s; even if authorized, he should not exhort them. The same restriction applies to bhikkhus undergoing the duties imposed by a transaction of censure, further punishment, demotion, banishment, suspension, or reconciliation. (See BMC2, <a href="../bmc2/bmc2.ch20.html">Chapter 20</a>. For more details on the authorization procedures, see <a href="../bmc2/bmc2.ch23.html">BMC2, Chapter 23</a>.)</p>

<p>As the Commentary notes, the group-of-six bhikkhus never possessed the above eight qualities even in their dreams.</p>

<p>One's perception as to whether one was properly authorized is not a factor here (see <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</p>


<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> Although this rule grew from a time when bhikkhus were eager to exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s, times changed. The Cullavagga (X.9.5) deals with a period when the bhikkhus tried to avoid exhorting the bhikkhun&#299;s, and Cv.X.9.4 tells what should be done when there is no bhikkhu qualified to exhort them. (The bhikkhus were to tell them, "Strive for completion (in the practice) in an amicable way.")</p>

<p>Even in these cases, though, the bhikkhun&#299;s were not left adrift. They could approach any bhikkhu they admired and ask him for instruction. Thus the Vibha&#7749;ga's non-offense clauses here say, "There is no offense when, having given the exposition, having given the interrogation, and then, after being requested by the bhikkhun&#299;s to recite, he recites." According to the Commentary, "exposition" here means a recitation of the eight rules in Pali, whereas "interrogation" means the ancient commentary on the eight rules. This last is hardly likely. What seems more likely is that "exposition" means establishing that the bhikkhun&#299;s have all come; "interrogation," questioning them as to whether they have memorized the eight rules. At any rate, the Commentary goes on to say that, when a bhikkhu has been invited like this, he is free to speak about the eight rules or any other Dhamma topic without offense. Again, this seems unlikely, for the Vibha&#7749;ga is very precise in the terminology it uses for the various stages leading up to the exhortation, and <i>recites</i> (<i>os&#257;reti</i>) is not the verb it uses for speaking about a topic. Instead, it usually means repeating a passage from memory.</p>

<p>However, there is a non-offense clause in the Vibha&#7749;ga that allows for an unauthorized bhikkhu to exhort a bhikkhun&#299; (or bhikkhun&#299;s) on the eight rules or any other topic in the following situation: if, being asked a question by a bhikkhun&#299;, one answers her question. There is also no offense if a bhikkhun&#299; happens to overhear any instruction one is giving for the sake of another person.</p>

<p><b>Subsidiary rules.</b> The Vibha&#7749;ga to this rule includes a discussion of three subsidiary rules related to the exhortation of the bhikkhun&#299;s:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>1) A bhikkhu, even if authorized, incurs a dukka&#7789;a if he exhorts an incomplete group of bhikkhun&#299;s, regardless of whether he perceives them as complete or not. The Sub-commentary notes, however, that according to the Vibha&#7749;ga to the Bhikkhun&#299;s' <a href="bmc1.ch08-6.html#Pc58">Pc 58</a> an ill bhikkhun&#299; is not obliged to go to an exhortation. Thus if all the bhikkhun&#299;s except the ill ones have come, the group counts as complete. If the group is complete and yet the bhikkhu perceives it as incomplete or is in doubt, then if he still goes ahead with the exhortation he incurs a dukka&#7789;a.</li>
	</ul>




	<ul>
	<li>2) If an authorized bhikkhu, after asking the bhikkhun&#299;s if they have all come, speaks of another Dhamma (instead of asking them if the eight rules have been memorized), he incurs a dukka&#7789;a.</li>

	<li>3) If, without having first introduced the exhortation, he speaks of another Dhamma, he incurs a dukka&#7789;a. According to the Commentary, "introducing" an exhortation means simply announcing, "This, sisters, is the exhortation." (See the origin story to the following rule for an example of this practice.)</li>
	</ul>


<p class="BMC_summary">
<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  Exhorting a bhikkhun&#299; about the eight rules of respect &#8212; except when one has been authorized to do so by the Community or asked a question by a bhikkhun&#299; &#8212; is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>
</div>


<div class="BMC_rule">
<p class="BMC_definition">
<a id="Pc22"><span class="BMC_num">22.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu, even if authorized, exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s after sunset, it is to be confessed.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
	<p>"Now at that time it was Ven. C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka's turn to exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s. The bhikkhun&#299;s said, 'Today the exhortation won't be effective, for Master C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka will simply say the same old stanza over and over again.'</p>

	<p>"Then the bhikkhun&#299;s went to Ven. C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, Ven. C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka said to them, 'Are you all present, sisters?'</p>

	<p>"'Yes, venerable sir, we are all present.'</p>

	<p>"'Are the eight rules of respect being kept up?'</p>

	<p>"'Yes, venerable sir, they are being kept up.'</p>

	<p>"Having introduced (the exhortation, saying,) 'This, sisters, is the exhortation,' he said this stanza over and over again:</p>
<div class="verse">
		<p>Heightened in mind and heedful,<br />
		the sage trained in sagacity's ways:<br />
		He has no sorrows, one who is Such,<br />
		calmed and ever mindful.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="excerpt">
	<p>"The bhikkhun&#299;s said (to one another), 'Didn't we say so? Today the exhortation won't be effective, for now Master C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka will simply say the same old stanza over and over again.'</p>

	<p>"Ven. C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka heard the bhikkhun&#299;s' conversation. Rising up into the air, he walked back and forth in space, in the sky, stood, sat, lay down, emitted smoke, emitted flames, and disappeared, saying the same old stanza and many other sayings of the Buddha. The bhikkhun&#299;s said, 'Isn't it amazing? Isn't it astounding? Never before has there been an exhortation as effective as Master C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka's!'</p>

	<p>"Then Ven. C&#363;&#7735;apanthaka, having exhorted the bhikkhun&#299;s until nightfall, dismissed them: 'You may go, sisters.' So the bhikkhun&#299;s &#8212; the gates of the city being closed &#8212; spent the night outside the city walls and entered the city only after daybreak. People criticized and complained and spread it about, 'These bhikkhun&#299;s are unchaste. Having spent the night with the bhikkhus in the monastery, only now are they entering the city.'"</p>
</div>

<p>The factors for the full offense here are two.</p>

<p><b>Object.</b> As with the preceding rule, a bhikkhun&#299; or group of bhikkhun&#299;s who have received the double ordination are grounds for a p&#257;cittiya here. A bhikkhun&#299; who has received only her first ordination, from the Bhikkhun&#299; Sa&#7749;gha, is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a, while female trainees and female novices are not grounds for an offense.</p>

<p><b>Effort.</b> One exhorts the bhikkhun&#299;(s) about the eight rules or any other Dhamma after the sun has set. Perception as to whether the sun has actually set is not a mitigating factor here (see <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</p>


<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> Although the origin story suggests that it is unwise in any case to teach bhikkhun&#299;s after sunset &#8212; because of the suspicions that such an action may provoke &#8212; the non-offense clauses give more respect to the bhikkhun&#299;s' desire for instruction than to the fear of gossiping lay people. As under the preceding rule, a bhikkhu may recite for the bhikkhun&#299;s after sunset if, after he has given them the exposition and interrogation, they request that he recite. He also incurs no offense if he teaches any topic of Dhamma after sunset in response to a bhikkhun&#299;'s question, or if a bhikkhun&#299; after sunset happens to overhear any instruction he is giving for the sake of another person.</p>

<p class="BMC_summary">
<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  Exhorting bhikkhun&#299;s on any topic at all after sunset &#8212; except when they request it &#8212; is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>
</div>

<p class="BMC_definition">
<a id="Pc23"><span class="BMC_num">23.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu, having gone to the bhikkhun&#299;s' quarters, exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s &#8212; except at the proper occasion &#8212; it is to be confessed. Here the proper occasion is this: A bhikkhun&#299; is ill. This is the proper occasion here.</p>

<p>Here again there are two factors for the full offense:</p>

<p><b>Object:</b> a bhikkhun&#299; who is not ill. <i>Ill</i> means that she is unable to go to an exhortation or to an "affiliation" (<i>sa&#7747;v&#257;sa</i>), which the New K/Sub-commentary defines as a Community meeting such as the uposatha.</p>

<p>As with the preceding rule, a bhikkhun&#299; or group of bhikkhun&#299;s who have received the double ordination are grounds for a p&#257;cittiya here. A bhikkhun&#299; who has received only her first ordination, from the Bhikkhun&#299; Sa&#7749;gha, is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a, while female trainees and female novices are not grounds for an offense.</p>

<p><b>Effort.</b> One goes to her residence &#8212; any place where a bhikkhun&#299; has spent at least one night &#8212; and exhorts her concerning the eight rules of respect. Exhorting her about any other topic is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a. Perception with regard to her status as ordained is not a mitigating factor here (see <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</p>


<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> As the rule states, there is no offense for the bhikkhu who goes to the bhikkhun&#299;s' quarters to exhort an ill bhikkhun&#299;. Otherwise, the non-offense clauses are identical with those for the preceding rule. Here again, a bhikkhun&#299;'s desire for instruction is considered more important than the suspicions of the laity.</p>

<p class="BMC_summary">
<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  Going to the bhikkhun&#299;s' quarters and exhorting a bhikkhun&#299; about the eight rules of respect &#8212; except when she is ill or has requested the instruction &#8212; is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>
</div>


<div class="BMC_rule">
<p class="BMC_definition">
<a id="Pc24"><span class="BMC_num">24.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu say that the bhikkhus exhort the bhikkhun&#299;s for the sake of worldly gain, it is to be confessed.</p>

<p>Here the factors for the full offense are three.</p>

<p><b>Object:</b> a bhikkhu who has been properly authorized to teach the bhikkhun&#299;s and who is not teaching for the sake of worldly gain: either material (robes, almsfood, lodgings, or medicine) or immaterial (honor, respect, reverence, homage, or veneration).</p>

<p>A bhikkhu who has not been properly authorized is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a, as is a non-ordained person, properly authorized or not. (The PTS edition of the Canon contains a wheel in which a person not properly authorized and perceived as not properly authorized is not grounds for an offense, but this contradicts the passages earlier in the Vibha&#7749;ga which make the above points. The same wheel in the Thai, Burmese, and Sri Lankan editions is thus more correct in saying that a person not properly authorized and perceived as such is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a.)</p>

<p>Perception as to the validity of the bhikkhu's authorization is not a mitigating factor here. If it was valid, he is grounds for a p&#257;cittiya whether one perceives it as valid, invalid, or doubtful. If it was invalid, he is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a whether one perceives it as valid, invalid, or doubtful. This is another case where the pattern set out under <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a> does not hold.</p>


<p><b>Intention.</b> One's motive is to make him lose face, lose status, or feel abashed (the same intention as under <a href="bmc1.ch08-2.html#Pc13">Pc 13</a>).</p>


<p><b>Effort.</b> One accuses him of teaching for the sake of worldly gain, as defined above.</p>

<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> If the bhikkhu does actually teach for the sake of worldly gain, there is no offense in stating the facts of the case. However, as we noted in the similar case under <a href="bmc1.ch08-2.html#Pc13">Pc 13</a>, this exemption does not apply in cases where one's perception that he teaches for the sake of worldly gain is mistaken, so one must be careful that one's perception is accurate.</p>


<p class="BMC_summary">
<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  Saying that a properly authorized bhikkhu exhorts the bhikkhun&#299;s for the sake of worldly gain &#8212; when in fact that is not the case &#8212; is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>

<div class="BMC_rule">
<p class="BMC_definition">
<a id="Pc25"><span class="BMC_num">25.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu give robe-cloth to a bhikkhun&#299; unrelated to him, except in exchange, it is to be confessed.</p>

<p>This rule is the counterpart to <a href="bmc1.ch07-1.html#NP5">NP 5</a>. The full offense is composed of two factors: object and effort.</p>


<p><b>Object:</b> any piece of robe-cloth of the six suitable kinds, measuring at least four by eight fingerbreadths. Other requisites are not grounds for an offense.</p>

<p><b>Effort.</b> The bhikkhu gives the cloth to an unrelated bhikkhun&#299; and does not receive anything from her in exchange.</p>

<p><i>Unrelated bhikkhun&#299;</i> here is defined in the same terms as under <a href="bmc1.ch07-1.html#NP4">NP 4</a>: a bhikkhun&#299; who has received the double ordination and is not related to the bhikkhu back through their great x 7 grandfathers. An unrelated bhikkhun&#299; who has received only her first ordination, from the bhikkhun&#299;s, is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a. Female trainees and female novices are not grounds for an offense.</p>


<p>Perception as to whether the bhikkhun&#299; is actually one's relative is not a mitigating factor here (see <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</p>


<p>The Commentary states that the giving need not be hand-to-hand. If a bhikkhu simply places the cloth near a bhikkhun&#299; as his way of giving it to her, and she accepts it as given, this factor is fulfilled.</p>

<p>As for the item given in exchange for the cloth, the Vibha&#7749;ga states that it can be worth much more than the cloth or much less. Buddhaghosa quotes the Mah&#257; Paccar&#299;, one of the ancient commentaries, as saying that even if, in return for the cloth, the bhikkhun&#299; gives the bhikkhu a piece of yellow myrobalan &#8212; a medicinal fruit, one of the cheapest things imaginable in India &#8212; he escapes the penalty under this rule.</p>

<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> There is no offense if:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>the bhikkhun&#299; is a relation;</li>

	<li>she is not related, but she gives one something in exchange;</li>

	<li>she takes the cloth on trust;</li>

	<li>she borrows the cloth;</li>

	<li>one gives her a non-cloth requisite; or</li>

	<li>one gives robe-cloth to a female trainee or female novice.</li>
	</ul>

<a id="Pc26"><span class="BMC_num">26.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu sew robe-cloth or have it sewn for a bhikkhun&#299; unrelated to him, it is to be confessed.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
	<p>"Now at that time Ven. Ud&#257;yin had become accomplished in making robes. A certain bhikkhun&#299; went to him and on arrival said, 'It would be good, venerable sir, if you sewed me a robe.' So Ven. Ud&#257;yin, having sewed a robe for the bhikkhun&#299;, having dyed it well and stitched it nicely, having embroidered an obscene design in the middle (a man and woman in mid-intercourse, done in full color, says the Commentary), and having folded it up, placed it to one side. Then the bhikkhun&#299; went to him and on arrival said, 'Where is the robe, venerable sir?'</p>

	<p>"'Here you are, sister. Take this robe as it is folded and place it aside. When the Community of bhikkhun&#299;s comes for exhortation, put it on and come behind them.'</p>

	<p>"So the bhikkhun&#299; took the robe as it was folded and placed it aside. When the Community of bhikkhun&#299;s came for exhortation, she put it on and came behind them. People criticized and complained and spread it about, 'How brazen these bhikkhun&#299;s are, how mischievous and shameless, in that they embroider an obscene design on a robe!'</p>

	<p>"The bhikkhun&#299;s said, 'Whose work is this?'</p>

	<p>"'Master Ud&#257;yin's,' the bhikkhun&#299; answered.</p>

	<p>"'A thing like this wouldn't be attractive even from those who are brazen, mischievous, and shameless, much less from Master Ud&#257;yin (&#167;).'"</p>
</div>

<p>The full offense here has three factors.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><i>1) Effort:</i> One sews &#8212; or gets someone else to sew &#8212;</li>

	<li><i>2) Object:</i> a robe</li>

	<li><i>3) Intention:</i> for the sake of a bhikkhun&#299; unrelated to oneself.</li>
	</ul>


<p><b>Effort.</b> The Vibha&#7749;ga says that there is a p&#257;cittiya for every stitch one makes in the robe-cloth. If one gets someone else to sew it, there is a p&#257;cittiya in giving the command or making the request, and another p&#257;cittiya when the other person does as commanded/requested, no matter how many stitches he/she makes.</p>

<p><b>Object.</b> The Vibha&#7749;ga defines <i>robe</i> here as meaning any of the six kinds of robe-cloth, even a piece measuring at least four by eight fingerbreadths. This would seem to suggest that cloth being sewn into any object would come under this rule, but the non-offense clauses give an exemption for sewing "any requisite aside from a robe," so only cloth being sewn into a robe would fulfill the factor of effort here.</p>

<p><b>Intention.</b> This factor is fulfilled only if the robe-cloth being sewn is intended for an unrelated bhikkhun&#299;, as under the preceding rule: a bhikkhun&#299; who has received the double ordination and is not related to the bhikkhu back through their great x 7 grandfathers. An unrelated bhikkhun&#299; who has received only her first ordination, from the bhikkhun&#299;s, is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a. Related bhikkhun&#299;s are not grounds for an offense, nor are female trainees or female novices.</p>

<p>Perception as to whether the bhikkhun&#299; is actually one's relative is not a mitigating factor here (see <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</p>


<p>The Commentary states that if Bhikkhu X is sewing robe-cloth for a bhikkhun&#299; related to him, and Bhikkhu Y &#8212; who is not related to her &#8212; helps him sew it, Bhikkhu Y incurs a p&#257;cittiya for every stitch he sews in the cloth. The Sub-commentary adds, though, that if Bhikkhu Y does not know that the cloth is for the bhikkhun&#299;, he is exempt from the offense.</p>

<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> There is no offense in sewing a cloth requisite other than a robe for an unrelated bhikkhun&#299;, in sewing anything for a bhikkhun&#299; who is a relation, or in sewing anything for a female trainee or female novice, related or not.</p>

<p class="BMC_summary">
<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  Sewing a robe &#8212; or having it sewn &#8212; for an unrelated bhikkhun&#299; is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>
</div>


<div class="BMC_rule">
<p class="BMC_definition">
<a id="Pc27"><span class="BMC_num">27.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu, by arrangement, travel together with a bhikkhun&#299; even for the interval between one village and the next, except at the proper occasion, it is to be confessed. Here the proper occasion is this: The road is to be traveled by caravan (&#167;) and is considered dubious and risky. This is the proper occasion here.</p>

<p>Here the full offense has two factors.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><i>1) Object</i> a bhikkhun&#299;</li>

	<li><i>2) Effort:</i> (a) One makes an arrangement together with her to travel together; (b) one actually travels together with her as arranged (c) from one village to another (d) except on the allowable occasions.</li>
	</ul>


<p><b>Object.</b> A bhikkhun&#299; who has received the double ordination is grounds for a p&#257;cittiya here. Any other woman would come under <a href="bmc1.ch08-7.html#Pc67">Pc 67</a>.</p>


<p><b>Making an arrangement.</b> According to the Vibha&#7749;ga, both the bhikkhu and the bhikkhun&#299; must give their verbal assent to the arrangement for this part of the factor to be fulfilled. If the bhikkhu proposes the arrangement but the bhikkhun&#299; does not give her verbal assent, then even if they later travel together as he proposed, he incurs a dukka&#7789;a. If she proposes the arrangement but he does not give his verbal assent, then even if they later travel together as she proposed, he incurs no penalty.</p>

<p>Perception as to whether the factors for making an arrangement are actually fulfilled is not a mitigating factor here (see <a href="bmc1.ch08-1.html#Pc4">Pc 4</a>).</p>


<p>The texts do not address the case in which another person makes the arrangements for a bhikkhu and bhikkhun&#299; to travel together, say, as part of a larger group. However, the wording of the Vibha&#7749;ga's definition of arrangement &#8212; in which the bhikkhu and bhikkhun&#299; are addressing each other &#8212; and the non-offense clause allowing the two to travel together if they have not made an arrangement, suggest that as long as the bhikkhu and bhikkhun&#299; do not address each other &#8212; directly or through an intermediary &#8212; about making the trip, there is no offense in joining the group.</p>

<p><b>Going as arranged.</b> If a specific time frame was part of the arrangement, then the two parties must begin traveling together within that time frame for this factor to be fulfilled. If they happen to start out earlier or later than arranged, again the bhikkhu incurs no penalty. The examples in the Commentary suggest that "earlier" or "later" here involve fairly substantial amounts of time, i.e., going one day later than arranged, or going before the meal when the arrangement was to go after the meal. The Commentary also adds that if a specific place to meet or route to travel were part of the arrangement, any change in those factors would be irrelevant to the offense. For example, if they agreed to go by train but ended up going by car, the factor of "going as arranged" would still be fulfilled.</p>

<p><b>From one village to another.</b> There is some controversy as to whether this phrase &#8212; <i>g&#257;mantara</i> &#8212; means "from one village to another" or "from one house to another." According to Buddhaghosa, the ancient commentaries opted for "village," while he opts for "house." The ancient commentaries have the support of the Canon here, in that the term in question also occurs in Bhikkhun&#299;s' <a href="bmc1.ch05.html#Sg3">Sg 3</a> &amp; <a href="bmc1.ch08-4.html#Pc37">Pc 37</a>, where it definitely means the area outside a village and not the interval from one house to another within a village.</p>



<p>There is a p&#257;cittiya for every village-to-village interval one passes. In an area where there are no villages &#8212; i.e., says the Sub-commentary, where villages are further than half a league (8 km. or 5 miles) apart &#8212; there is a p&#257;cittiya for every half-league one travels together as arranged.</p>

<p><b>The allowable occasions.</b> A road to be traveled by caravan (&#167;) is one too dubious or risky to travel alone. (BD translates this as a "road to be traveled with a weapon," but because bhikkhus and bhikkhun&#299;s are not allowed even to touch weapons, it's a doubtful translation at best.)</p>

<p><i>Dubious</i> means that the eating, sleeping, sitting, or standing places of thieves have been seen along the road; <i>risky</i>, that people are known to have been beaten, plundered, or robbed by thieves there.</p>

<p>The Vibha&#7749;ga adds that if the road was believed to be dubious or risky but is later found to be safe, the exemption no longer holds, and the bhikkhus are to dismiss the bhikkhun&#299;s from their company.</p>

<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> There is no offense:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>if the bhikkhu and bhikkhun&#299; happen to travel together without having made an arrangement;</li>

	<li>if the bhikkhun&#299; proposes an arrangement, while the bhikkhu does not give his verbal assent;</li>

	<li>if they travel on a dubious and risky road; or</li>

	<li>if there are other dangers. The Commentary illustrates this last contingency with a stock phrase whose meaning admits two interpretations. It starts, "Savage tribes are attacking the countryside," and then comes the ambiguous part, either, "People mount their wheels (their carriages, says the Sub-commentary)," or, alternatively, "The tribes seize power (another meaning for 'wheel')."</li>

<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  Traveling by arrangement with a bhikkhun&#299; from one village to another &#8212; except when the road is risky or there are other dangers &#8212; is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>

<a id="Pc28"><span class="BMC_num">28.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu, by arrangement, get in the same boat with a bhikkhun&#299; going upstream or downstream &#8212; except to cross over to the other bank &#8212; it is to be confessed.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
	<p>"Now at that time, some group-of-six bhikkhus, having made an arrangement with some bhikkhun&#299;s, got in the same boat with them. People criticized and complained and spread it about: 'Just as we sport with our wives in a boat, so too these Sakyan-son monks, having made an arrangement with bhikkhun&#299;s, sport with them in a boat...'"</p>

	<p>(The Buddha then formulated the first version of this rule, without the exception for crossing over to the other bank.)</p>

	<p>"Then at that time a number of bhikkhus and bhikkhun&#299;s were traveling on the road from S&#257;keta to S&#257;vatth&#299;. Along the way, they had to cross over a river. The bhikkhun&#299;s said to the bhikkhus, 'We'll cross over with the masters.'</p>

	<p>"'Sisters, it isn't proper for bhikkhus, having made an arrangement, to get in the same boat with bhikkhun&#299;s. Either you cross over first or we will.'</p>

	<p>"'The masters are the foremost men. Let the masters cross over first.'</p>

	<p>"Then as the bhikkhun&#299;s were crossing over afterward, thieves robbed them and raped them."</p>
</div>

<p>The factors for the full offense here are similar to those for the preceding rule.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><i>1) Object</i> a bhikkhun&#299;.</li>

	<li><i>2) Effort:</i> (a) One makes an arrangement together with her to get in a boat together; (b) one actually travels together with her as arranged, going upstream or downstream along a river (c) from one village to another.</li>
	</ul>


<p><b>Object.</b> A bhikkhun&#299; who has received the double ordination is grounds for a p&#257;cittiya here. Unlike the case with many other rules in this section, the Vibha&#7749;ga here does not state that a bhikkhun&#299; who has received only her first ordination is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a, nor that a female trainee or a female novice would be grounds for no offense. This may have been an oversight. The Vibha&#7749;ga here closely follows the Vibha&#7749;ga to the preceding rule, which omits mentioning these three classes of women because they are covered by a parallel rule, <a href="bmc1.ch08-7.html#Pc67">Pc 67</a>. This rule, however, has no such parallel rule to cover these three classes, and so the omission here leaves them neither allowed nor forbidden by any rule.</p>


<p><b>Effort.</b> The conditions for making an arrangement here, as well as those concerning the issue of perception about the arrangement, are identical with those under the preceding rule.</p>

<p>The next part of the factor &#8212; going as arranged &#8212; is fulfilled only if they get in the boat together within the time frame they had agreed on. If they get in earlier or later, there is no offense.</p>

<p>Once they get in the boat as arranged, the bhikkhu incurs a p&#257;cittiya for every village-to-village interval they pass along the riverbank while going upstream or downstream. If the villages are further than 8 km. apart, he incurs a p&#257;cittiya for every 8 km. they travel together.</p>

<p>The commentaries add "intention" as an additional factor here &#8212; the bhikkhu's purpose in traveling with the bhikkhun&#299;(s) is for amusement &#8212; but there is no basis for this in the Vibha&#7749;ga.</p>

<p><b>Non-offenses.</b> As the rule says, there is no offense in making an arrangement and crossing over a river with a bhikkhun&#299;. The Commentary adds that this applies not only to rivers but also to oceans: If one travels from one seaport to another by arrangement with a bhikkhun&#299;, no penalty is entailed.</p>

<p>The K/Commentary goes even further and says that this rule applies only to rivers, and that a bhikkhu seeking some amusement with a bhikkhun&#299; may make a date with her and travel around the ocean as much as he likes with no offense. The Sub-commentary disagrees with both the Commentary and K/Commentary here, saying that a bhikkhu traveling by arrangement with a bhikkhun&#299; in a boat on the ocean incurs a dukka&#7789;a for every 8 km. they travel. The Sub-commentary's position here is more in keeping with the Great Standards and so carries more weight.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no offense if:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>the bhikkhu and bhikkhun&#299; happen to travel together in the same boat without having made an arrangement;</li>

	<li>the bhikkhun&#299; proposes an arrangement, while the bhikkhu does not give his verbal assent; or</li>

	<li>there are dangers.</li>

	<ul>
	<li><i>1) Object</i> any of the five staple foods (see the preface to the <a href="bmc1.ch08-4.html">Food Chapter</a>, below) offered by a lay person at the instigation of a bhikkhun&#299;.</li>

	<li><i>2) Perception:</i> One knows that it was offered at her instigation.</li>

	<li><i>3) Effort:</i> One eats the food.</li>
	</ul>


<p><b>Object.</b> Any of the five staple foods is grounds for a p&#257;cittiya. Any edible aside from them is not grounds for an offense.</p>

<p><i>Bhikkhun&#299;</i> here refers to one who has received the double ordination. The Vibha&#7749;ga notes that one who has received only her first ordination &#8212; from the Bhikkhun&#299; Sa&#7749;gha &#8212; is grounds for a dukka&#7789;a, while female trainees and female novices are not grounds for an offense.</p>

<p><i>Instigating</i> means that the bhikkhun&#299; speaking to a lay person who is not already planning to give food to Bhikkhu X, praises X or suggests that food should be presented to him. If the lay person was already planning to give food to X, this factor is not fulfilled. The Vibha&#7749;ga defines <i>already planning to give food</i> in the following terms: Either X and the lay person are related, the lay person has previously invited X to ask for food, or the lay person has already prepared the food in question for X of his/her own accord prior to the bhikkhun&#299;'s instigation.</p>

<p><b>Perception.</b> If one is in doubt as to whether the food was offered at a bhikkhun&#299;'s instigation, the penalty for eating it is a dukka&#7789;a regardless of whether it was. If one thinks that it was offered at her instigation when it actually wasn't, the penalty for eating it is again a dukka&#7789;a. If one does not perceive it as offered at her instigation, then whether it was or wasn't, there is no offense.</p>

<p><b>Effort.</b> There is a dukka&#7789;a for accepting food with the purpose of eating it, and a p&#257;cittiya for every mouthful one eats.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><b>Non-offenses.</b> There is no offense if:</li>

	<li>one does not know,</li>

	<li>the food offered is not one of the five staples,</li>

	<li>the lay person was instigated by a female trainee or female novice, or</li>

	<li>the lay person was already planning to present one with the food before the bhikkhun&#299;'s instigation. As we noted above, one's relatives, people who have invited one to ask for food, and people who ordinarily provide one with food also fit under this allowance.</li>
	</ul>


<p class="BMC_summary">
<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  Eating any of the five staple foods that a lay person has offered as the result of a bhikkhun&#299;'s prompting &#8212; unless the lay person was already planning to offer the food before her prompting &#8212; is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>
</div>


<div class="BMC_rule">
<p class="BMC_definition">
<a id="Pc30"><span class="BMC_num">30.</span></a> Should any bhikkhu sit in private, alone with a bhikkhun&#299;, it is to be confessed.</p>

<p>Except for one rare case &#8212; a bhikkhun&#299; who does not know what is lewd and not lewd &#8212; this rule is completely subsumed under <a href="bmc1.ch08-5.html#Pc45">Pc 45</a>. For explanations, see the discussion under that rule.</p>


<p class="BMC_summary">
<span class="BMC_sum">Summary:</span>  When aiming at privacy, sitting or lying down alone with a bhikkhun&#299; in an unsecluded but private place with no one else present is a p&#257;cittiya offense.</p>
