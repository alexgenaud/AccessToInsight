<dt>What is Access to Insight? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='whatis' id='whatis'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Access to Insight is an Internet website dedicated to providing accurate, reliable, and useful information concerning the practice and study of Theravada Buddhism, as it has been handed down to us through both the written word of the Pali canon and the living example of the Sangha.</p>
<p>Access to Insight is not an organization and is not affiliated with any institution. It is simply one person's website. Although I have studied the Buddha's teachings for many years as a dedicated lay follower, I have no academic degrees in either the Pali language or Buddhist Studies. In these pages I have therefore relied on the translations and interpretations of other respected scholars, teachers, and practitioners who have far more experience and wisdom than do I.</p>
<p>The readings assembled here represent just a selection of the Buddha's teachings. These are the ones that, over the years, I've personally found to be helpful in deepening an understanding of Dhamma practice. This collection is not meant to be an exhaustive archive of Theravada Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>I've tried to avoid injecting my own views and opinions into these web pages. Some biases, however, inevitably intrude, owing to the editorial choices I've made and the short introductory essays and blurbs I've written here and there to give some context to the material being presented. I sincerely hope that my biases do not in any way obscure the real meaning of the texts themselves.</p>
<p>Everything available at Access to Insight is offered in full cooperation with the authors, translators, and publishers concerned, with the clear understanding that none of it is to be sold. Please help yourself to whatever you find useful. (For a detailed explanation of the copyright status of materials on the website, please read "<a href="#copyright">Copyright and Related Issues</a>.")</p>
</dd>

<dt>How did Access to Insight start? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='history' id='history'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In early 1993, with the help of the <a href='http://www.dharma.org/bcbs' title='Visit www.dharma.org' class='offsite' target='offsite' >Barre Center for Buddhist Studies</a>, I set up in my basement a computer bulletin board service (BBS) to see if networked computers might be genuinely useful as a support for students and practitioners of Buddhism. Originally dubbed "BCBS OnLine," the BBS soon joined DharmaNet's international network of dialup Buddhist BBS's and adopted the name "Access to Insight." Shortly thereafter, Barry Kapke launched DharmaNet's Dharma Book Transcription Project, of which I served as librarian, and under whose auspices about a hundred high-quality books on Buddhism were transcribed to computer through the dedicated efforts of an international team of volunteer transcribers and proofreaders. These books were soon distributed via DharmaNet to scores of BBS's around the world. In 1994 I installed a dialup Internet e-mail connection that allowed anyone on the Internet to retrieve these books via an e-mail file server. This proved to be a popular service. By late 1994 the BBS &mdash; now independent of BCBS &mdash; spent far more of its time serving file requests from around the world via the Internet than in handling the requests of local callers. Internet users from far and wide were coming to depend on Access to Insight's now rickety and overworked '386 computer as their link to information &mdash; both the timely and the timeless &mdash; about Buddhism. In March 1995 this website was born; eight months later I closed down the BBS for good.</p>
<p>Today Access to Insight continues to grow: what began in 1993 as a modest collection of two or three suttas and a handful of articles has blossomed into a library of more than one thousand suttas and several hundred articles and books. With the release of the <i>Handful of Leaves</i> CD-ROM in 1998 and 1999, these texts are now reaching an even wider audience and being further redistributed around the world in print and electronic media.</p>

<dt>How can I contact you? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='contact' id='contact'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>If you have a question, please first check to see if it is already answered in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, the <a href="help.html">Help</a> file, the <a href="index-subject.html">Indexes</a>, or the <a href="search_results.html">Search Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Please understand that Access to Insight isn't an organization and there are no staff here &mdash; it's just me. I do not have time to answer &mdash; or even acknowledge &mdash; all the emails that I receive. If you have questions about the content of this website &mdash; or about the Dhamma in general &mdash; please consult a teacher or a knowledgeable friend. I'm just the librarian. I am always grateful, however, to receive reports of errors (broken links, typos, etc.). </p>

<dt>If Access to Insight isn't run by an organization, why does its URL end in ".org"? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='domain' id='domain'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <b>.com</b> top-level domain isn't quite right since I'm not selling anything. <b>.net</b> isn't quite right either, since the website isn't part of a network. <b>.org</b> suggests a non-commercial entity, which this site certainly is. Maybe someday we'll have more top-level domains to choose from (<b>.disorg</b> or <b>.notcom</b> would be nice). Until that day comes, Access to Insight will muddle along, a squarish peg in a web of roundish holes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Is Access to Insight affiliated with any meditation center or monastery? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='ims' id='ims'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd><p>No.</p></dd>

<dt>How do you decide which texts to include on the website? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='include' id='include'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>One overarching principle has guided my choice of what to include in these pages, and what to leave out: a conviction that the teachings found in the Pali canon are just as relevant today as when they were first put into practice <a href="history.html#awakening">2,600 years ago</a>. Despite all the obvious material advances in the human world since the Buddha's time, the <a href="ptf/dhamma/sacca/index.html">Four Noble Truths</a> appear to be as vital today as ever: suffering and stress still pervade our lives; the cause still appears to be craving in all its insidious manifestations; and there is no reason to suspect that the <a href="ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/index.html">Noble Eightfold Path</a> is any less effective today at bringing an end to all that suffering and stress.</p>
<p>The emphasis here is on practice. For the most part I've selected books, articles, and sutta translations that I've personally found helpful to develop a better understanding of the Buddha's teachings, rather than texts that tend to fuel intellectual debates on abstract philosophical concepts. Beyond these basic principles, it all comes down to a matter of personal taste.</p>
<p>If you are looking for authors or teachers who are not represented on Access to Insight, a simple <a href='http://www.google.com' title='Visit www.google.com' class='offsite' target='offsite' >Google</a> search may be fruitful.</p>

	Why don't you have translations of ALL the suttas from the Pali canon?&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='moreplease' id='moreplease'>&nbsp;</a><br /><!--jtb 010226-->
	Why don't you have such-and-such a sutta (or article)?<br />

</dt>

<dd>
<p>This website aims to be selective rather than comprehensive. My goal has never been to publish translations of every single one of the Tipitaka's 10,000-plus suttas. What you see here is a selection of suttas that meet three criteria: (1) they are, in my opinion, good translations; (2) I have personally found them useful; and (3) their copyright holders have provided them for free distribution.</p>
<p>There are many other fine translations of important suttas available in print today, and I encourage you to support their continued publication by purchasing copies. Someday, perhaps, these publishers will make those translations available freely to all. Until then, however, we must learn to make do with what we have. <!-- This last sentence is directed at those who insist, sometimes with great stridency and impatience, that ALL Dhamma should be made freely available, NOW! --> Happily, what we already have is pretty darn wonderful. </p>
<p>The same criteria apply to my selection of books, articles, and other materials on the site.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Why don't you have any translations or articles in languages other than English? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='foreign' id='foreign'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Years ago I decided to limit Access to Insight's content exclusively to the English language, simply because I am fluent only in English. I prefer not to put anything on the website that I can't understand myself.</p>
<p>If you're looking for Theravada texts in other languages, please see "<a href='outsources/foreign.html'>Off-site resources: Non-English Tipitaka translations</a>".</p>

<dt>Whom can we thank for making all these texts available? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#general' name='thank' id='thank'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>My role in assembling Access to Insight has primarily been that of facilitator and librarian, helping to bring together under one virtual roof the fruits of the hard work of many people: authors, translators, publishers, transcribers, and proofreaders. The unstinting generosity and commitment to the Dhamma demonstrated by these many contributors continues to amaze and inspire me. If you have found anything of value at Access to Insight please join me in thanking those who have made this website possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="index-author.html#bodhi">Bhikkhu Bodhi</a>, former President of the <a href="outsources/books.html#bps">Buddhist Publication Society</a> in Kandy, Sri Lanka, for allowing many of the BPS's publications (including its <i><a href="lib/bpslist.html#wheels">Wheel</a></i> and <i><a href="lib/bpslist.html#leaves">Bodhi Leaves</a></i> titles, among others) to be transcribed to computer and distributed on the Internet.</li>
<li><a href="index-author.html#thanissaro">Thanissaro Bhikkhu</a> (Ajaan Geoff), for kindly making available all his own books and articles, as well as his translations of teachings by many of the great <a href="lib/thai/index.html">Thai forest masters</a>. Ajaan Geoff has also provided the vast majority of Access to Insight's sutta translations (close to one thousand of them are his).</li>
<li>The many volunteer transcribers and proofreaders who have given their time and energy to make available so many fine Dhamma books:

The amulet depicts an image of the Buddha meditating under the arch of a protective deity, or <i>naga</i>, in a design popularized by Somdet Toh (1788-1872).<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-image-1' id='fnt-image-1' name='fnt-image-1'>[1]</a> The reverse (below, right) contains the Pali text (in Thai script) of the Jinapa&ntilde;jara Gatha ("The Victor's Cage"; see <a href="lib/authors/dhammayut/chanting.html">"A Chanting Guide"</a>), a traditional protective chant that describes a person surrounded on all sides by a field of extraordinary purity and goodness: the <a href="ptf/tisarana.html">Triple Gem</a>, all the past Buddhas, all the Buddha's elder arahant disciples, and &mdash; as if that weren't enough &mdash; all the suttas. In a dangerous and frightening world it is hard to imagine a safer place in which to dwell.</p>

<!--
<p>Amulets have enjoyed a long and colorful history in the world of Theravada Buddhism. Usually depicting the Buddha or one of his disciples, amulets have been fashioned from almost every imaginable material: stone, metal, ceramic, bone, or elaborate concoctions of pressed clay, ash, human hair, and perfumes. An amulet that has been blessed by a monk of notable purity and wisdom is widely believed to be charged with protective powers. Stories of the supernatural surround amulets even today. Some Buddhists give their amulets a place of honor next to the Buddha statue on the shrine at home; others wear them casually as good luck charms or hang them from the rearview mirror as protection against misfortune (or their own careless driving habits). Collectors buy, sell, and trade amulets, always on the lookout for those believed to possess unusual powers.</p>
 -->

<p>But, of course, it is the purity and goodness of the mind that offers the only true protection. By seeking out the company of a <a href="ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-ditthi/kalyanamittata.html"><i>kalyanamitta</i></a> (spiritual friend)  and by training oneself to infuse the mind only with  what is good and noble, progress on the <a href="ptf/dhamma/index.html">path of Dhamma</a> is assured. The Victor's Cage &mdash; and the amulet on which it appears &mdash; thus serves as metaphor and reminder of the admirable qualities of mind that the practicing Buddhist strives to develop. As with the <a href="lib/study/recollections.html">ten recollections</a>, reflecting on the Victor's Cage offers encouragement when the chips are down: <i>I am not alone in this endeavor; I can do this</i>. In times of anxiety and stress, when the mind is most susceptible to wandering off into unskillful states, a recollection like this is sometimes all that's needed to restore the mind to balance and to steer it onwards down the path. And sometimes the familiar feel of a well-worn amulet between one's fingers is enough to do the trick.</p>
<p>My hope is that this website may serve its visitors in much the same way.</p>

	<dd>I'm grateful to a reader (Lam Cheng Poh) for pointing out that the arch above the Buddha has another possible interpretation. LCP writes:
<blockquote style='font-style:italic'>
<p>"Most Thai amulet collectors view the arch as a bell. Somdej Toh was abbot of Wat Rakang, i.e., Bell Temple, and the bell has given its name to the arch. The arch is invariably referred to as a "rakang" in any amulet of this iconography.</p>
<p>"The naga-over-the-Buddha amulets (ie Phra Nakprok) typically feature a 7-headed Mucalinda and are not known to be stylised into an abstract arch.</p>
<p>"I suspect the amulet is issued by one of 3 temples closely associated with Somdet Toh, ie Wat Rakang, Wat Inn and Wat Bangkhunpom, where he made many of these amulets.  The Jinapanjara Katha began to be featured on these amulets some 4 years ago, because Somdet Toh was supposed to have used that katha to consecrate all of his amulets. A more likely reason is that the minting technology finally caught up and permitted the katha to be squeezed onto the small surface area."</p>
<p class='cite'>&mdash; from an email received on 28 August 2008.</p>

<dt>How do I use the RSS feed? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#ati' name='rssfeed' id='rssfeed'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>ATI's RSS feed is a handy way to keep track of what's new at Access to Insight, without actually visiting the "What's New" section of the home page.</p>
<p>There are several ways to use the feed:</p>
<ul style='list-style: disc'>
	<li><b>Chrome.</b> Install the <a href='http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd' title='Visit chrome.google.com' class='offsite' target='offsite' >RSS Subscription</a> extension. Then point your browser to <a href='http://www.accesstoinsight.org'>ATI's home page</a>. You should see the RSS icon <img src='img/rss-chrome.png' alt='rss icon' width='17' height='17' /> in the address bar. Click on that icon and a new tab should open, revealing the contents of the feed along with some options for saving it.
	<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>[These directions work for me on Google Chrome (Mac) version 15.0.874.121. Your mileage may vary.]</span>
	</li>

	<li><b>Firefox.</b> Install the <a href='http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rss-icon/' title='Visit addons.mozilla.org' class='offsite' target='offsite' >RSS Icon</a> extension. Then point your browser to <a href='http://www.accesstoinsight.org'>ATI's home page</a>. You should see the RSS icon <img src='img/rss-firefox.png' alt='rss icon' width='15' height='15' /> in the address bar. Click on that icon and a pop-up menu will appear, inviting you to save the feed as a "live bookmark". You can then visit that bookmark at any time to view the feed.
	<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>[These directions work for me on Firefox  (Mac) version 8.0.1. YMMV.]</span>
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Safari.</b> Point your browser to <a href='http://www.accesstoinsight.org'>ATI's home page</a>. You should see the RSS icon <img src='img/rss-safari.png' alt='rss icon' width='27' height='14' /> in the address bar. Click on that icon and the feed should appear, accompanied by a host of options in the sidebar. To save the feed as a bookmark, look for the "Actions" section of the sidebar and select "Add Bookmark..."
	<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>[These directions work for me on Safari (Mac) version 5.0.6. YMMV.]</span>
	</li>

	<li><b>Apple Mail.</b> Pull down the "File" menu and  select "Add RSS Feeds...". In the window that appears, click the "Specify a custom feed" button and paste this URL into the text box: <span style='font-family:monospace'>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/rss/news.rss.php</span> then click "Add". The feed will appear in the "RSS" section of the left sidebar of the main Mail window. You can optionally choose to have new feed items appear in your Mail in-box.
	<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>[These directions work for me on Apple Mail (Mac) version 3.6. YMMV.]</span>
	</li>

	<li><b>Any old newsreader.</b> Paste this feed URL into your newsreader program: <span style='font-family:monospace'>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/rss/news.rss.php</span>
	</li>

</ul>

<p>If these directions don't work for you, and you suspect that ATI's RSS feed might be broken, before contacting me please double-check that you <i>are</i> able to access a feed from another website. A good feed to test is the one at <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/' title='Visit www.nytimes.com' class='offsite' target='offsite' >New York Times</a>.</p>

<dt>Are Access to Insight's texts governed by an "Open Source" or "GNU" copyright?&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#copyright' name='gnu' id='gnu'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>No. Access to Insight's texts do not conform with two key principles of most "open source" software licenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not sell anything that comes from this website. (Open source licenses allow you to sell software.)</li>
<li>You may not modify the content of any of the texts that come from this website. (Open source licenses allow you to modify software.) You may, however, reformat the texts in any way you like &mdash; <a href="#reformat">see below</a>.</li>

<dd><p>Yes, provided that you make them available free of charge. I also ask that you please post a simple notice somewhere on your website acknowledging that the materials came from here. Although I don't require it, as a service to your visitors you might also consider including a link to <b>www.accesstoinsight.org</b>, so that your visitors can easily get hold of the most up-to-date editions of these texts (I steadily receive corrections and revisions from translators, authors, and publishers). Finally, please make it clear to your visitors what material on your site comes from here and what comes from other sources.</p></dd>

<!--

<dd><p>Yes. As long as you don't alter the underlying content, you may reformat pages to your heart's content. You may convert most files to Microsoft Word, PDF, or any other proprietary format.

<p>No. The amount you charge is irrelevant: if you charge one penny or one thousand dollars, you're still selling. It doesn't matter if you're hoping to make a profit or not. What you do with the money you receive is irrelevant. These teachings are to be <i>given away,</i> not sold.</p>
<p>Requiring someone to pay for reproduction costs or for shipping costs (packaging, postage, etc.) is equivalent to selling. If you were sending a birthday gift to a beloved family member, would you enclose a bill for the wrapping paper, ribbon, and postage? Of course not. A gift is a gift.</p>

<p>Please be very careful here. As long as you make it crystal clear that anyone may receive a copy free for the asking &mdash; regardless of whether he or she makes a donation &mdash; then that's fine. You should put no pressure &mdash; subtle or otherwise &mdash; on anyone to pay. These teachings are to be <i>given away,</i> not sold.</p>

<dt>Can you recommend any online Buddhist discussion groups? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#misc' name='lists' id='lists'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd><p>There are many online discussion groups that cover Buddhist topics &mdash; too many to list here. You'll have to do the research on your own: <a href='http://www.google.com' title='Visit www.google.com' class='offsite' target='offsite' >Google</a> is just a click away.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a Pali discussion group, try <a href='outsources/pali.html#learning'>here</a>.</p></dd>

<dt>How do I write [insert English word or phrase here] in the original Pali script?&nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#misc' name='tattoo' id='tattoo'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd><p>There is no Pali script. Pali is a spoken language with no alphabet of its own. Pali texts can be written phonetically using just about any alphabet: Devanagari, Thai, Burmese, Roman, Cyrillic, Klingon, etc.  Writing Pali in non-Indic languages, however, often requires the addition of special accents or diacritics to signify certain sounds not represented in the standard alphabet. So, if you are looking for a hand-written version of the word <i>mett&#257;</i> for a tattoo or a painting, it's very easy: you can write it out yourself, in any alphabet you like.</p>
<p>The Pali texts were first written down several centuries after the Buddha's death, at the <a href='history.html#council4'>Fourth Buddhist Council</a>. To see what those early &mdash; and beautiful! &mdash; written transcriptions look like, visit the <a href='http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/buddhism/fplf' title='Visit echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de' class='offsite' target='offsite' >Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation</a> website. To find a particular word or passage within those ancient manuscripts, you'll have to find a scholar who specializes in them.</p>

<dt>What are some good beginning books on Buddhism? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#misc' name='books' id='books'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Buddhist Dictionary,</i> by Nyanatiloka Mahathera (Kandy: <a href="outsources/books.html#bps">Buddhist Publication Society</a>, 1980). A classic handbook of important terms and concepts in Theravada Buddhism. A valuable reference for newcomers and veterans, alike.</li>
<li><i>Buddhist Religions: A Historical Introduction (fifth edition)</i> by R.H. Robinson, W.L. Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu (Belmont, California: <a href='http://www.wadsworth.com' title='Visit www.wadsworth.com' class='offsite' target='offsite' >Wadsworth</a>, 2005). An excellent introductory college-level text that traces the evolution of all the major schools of Buddhism from their beginnings to the present day.</li>
<li><i>Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness</i> by Ven. Henepola Gunaratana (Somerville, MA: <a href="outsources/books.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</a>, 2001). An excellent guide to bringing the eightfold path into one's daily life.</li>
<li><i>The Experience of Buddhism: Sources and Interpretations (second edition)</i> by John S. Strong (Belmont, California: <a href='http://www.wadsworth.com' title='Visit www.wadsworth.com' class='offsite' target='offsite' >Wadsworth</a>, 2002). A very useful anthology of excerpts from key Buddhist texts representing all the major schools of Buddhism. Although intended primarily as a companion to Robinson &amp; Johnson's <i>The Buddhist Religion (fourth edition)</i> (see <i>Buddhist Religions,</i> above), it stands well on its own.</li>
<li><i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> by Ven. Henepola Gunaratana (Somerville, MA: <a href="outsources/books.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</a>, 1992). A clear and helpful introduction to the practice of mindfulness meditation.</li>
<li><i><a href="lib/authors/thanissaro/noblestrategy.html">Noble Strategy: Essays on the Buddhist Path</a></i> by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (1999; available from <a href="outsources/books.html#metta">Metta Forest Monastery</a>). A fine collection of introductory essays, which are also <a href="lib/authors/thanissaro/noblestrategy.html">available individually here on the website</a>.</li>
<li><i><a href="lib/authors/thanissaro/refuge.html">Refuge: An Introduction to the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha</a></i> by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (Geoffrey DeGraff) (1996; Available from <a href="outsources/books.html#metta">Metta Forest Monastery</a>). A collection of short essays and readings from the Pali suttas that explain the basic principles of living and practicing the path of Dhamma.</li>
<li><i>What the Buddha Taught</i> by Walpola Rahula (New York: Grove Press, 1986). An overview of the teachings of Theravada Buddhism, including chapters on each of the Four Noble Truths, along with excerpts from selected suttas and the Dhammapada. For several decades, a standard introductory text. Readily available at many bookstores.</li>
<li>See also "<a href="begin.html">Beginnings</a>," which includes suggested readings on beginning meditation practice.</li>

<dt>Where can I find a copy of the complete Pali canon (Tipitaka)? &nbsp;<a title='Go up' class='back' href='#misc' name='tipitaka' id='tipitaka'>&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>
<dl>

<dt>Print editions:</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you're thinking of purchasing your own printed copy of the Tipitaka, be forewarned: the Pali canon is huge; owning a complete set is a serious commitment. The <a href="outsources/books.html#pts">Pali Text Society</a>'s edition of the Tipitaka (English translation) fills over 12,000 pages in approximately fifty hardbound volumes, taking up about five linear feet of shelf space, and costing about US$2,000. Moreover, a few of the more obscure books in the Tipitaka are simply unavailable in English translation, so if you really <i>must</i> read the entire Tipitaka, you'll just have to <a href="lib/pali.html">learn Pali</a>. The PTS has for over a century been the leading publisher of the Tipitaka, both in romanized Pali and in English translation, but many of their translations are now badly out of date. Much better translations of several portions of the Canon are now available from other publishers. Here are my recommendations for printed translations that add up to a useful &mdash; if incomplete &mdash; version of the Tipitaka:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="tipitaka/vin/index.html">Vinaya Pitaka</a>.</b> <i>The Book of the Discipline,</i> I.B. Horner, trans. (Oxford: <a href="outsources/books.html#pts">Pali Text Society</a>, 1993) [6 vols]. To study the many rules for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis that are scattered throughout the Vinaya Pitaka, see Thanissaro Bhikkhu's <i><a href="lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/index.html">The Buddhist Monastic Code, Volume I: The Patimokkha Training Rules Translated and Explained</a></i> and <i><a href="lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2/index.html">The Buddhist Monastic Code, Volume II: The Khandhaka Training Rules Translated and Explained</a></i></li>
<li>
<b><a href="tipitaka/sutta.html">Sutta Pitaka</a>.</b> An excellent anthology of selected suttas and texts from the five Nikayas is <i>Handful of Leaves,</i> Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (Santa Cruz: <a href="outsources/books.html#sati">Sati Center for Buddhist Studies</a>, 2003) [4 vols.]. Translations from specific portions of the Nikayas include the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Digha Nikaya:</b> <i>The Long Discourses of the Buddha</i> (formerly titled <i>Thus Have I Heard),</i> Maurice Walshe, trans. (Somerville, MA: <a href="outsources/books.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</a>, 1987) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Majjhima Nikaya:</b> <i>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha,</i> Bhikkhu &Ntilde;anamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans. (Somerville, MA: <a href="outsources/books.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</a>, 1995) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Samyutta Nikaya:</b> <i>The Connected Discourses of the Buddha,</i> Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans. (Somerville, MA: <a href="outsources/books.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</a>, 2000) [2 vols.]</li>
<li><b>Anguttara Nikaya:</b> <i>Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: A Complete Translation of the Anguttara Nikaya,</i> Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans. (Somerville, MA: <a href="outsources/books.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</a>, 2012) [1 vol.]. See also: <i>The Book of Gradual Sayings,</i> F.L. Woodward and E.M. Hare, trans. (Oxford: <a href="outsources/books.html#pts">Pali Text Society</a>, 1994) [5 vols.]</li>
<li>
<b>Khuddaka Nikaya</b> (for a more detailed list, see the <a href="tipitaka/kn/index.html">Khuddaka Nikaya page</a>):
<ul>
<li><b>Khuddakapatha:</b> <i>Handful of Leaves (Vol. 4),</i> Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (Santa Cruz: <a href="outsources/books.html#sati">Sati Center for Buddhist Studies</a>, 2003) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Dhammapada:</b> <i>Dhammapada: A Translation,</i> Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (Barre, Massachusetts: Dhamma Dana Publications, 1997; available from <a href="outsources/books.html#metta">Metta Forest Monastery</a>); <i>The Dhammmapada: Pali Text and Translation with Stories in Brief and Notes,</i> prose translation by Narada Thera (Buddhist Missionary Society, 1978; available from <a href="outsources/books.html#pariyatti">Pariyatti Books</a>) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Udana:</b> <i>The Udana and the Itivuttaka,</i> John D. Ireland, trans. (Kandy: <a href="outsources/books.html#bps">Buddhist Publication Society</a>, 1998) [1 vol.]</li>

(Barre, Massachusetts: Dhamma Dana Publications, 2001) [1 vol.] or <i>Handful of Leaves (Vol. 4),</i> Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (Santa Cruz: <a href="outsources/books.html#sati">Sati Center for Buddhist Studies</a>, 2003) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Suttanipata:</b> <i>The Group of Discourses (2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> ed.),</i> K.R. Norman, trans. (Oxford: <a href="outsources/books.html#pts">Pali Text Society</a>, 2001) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Theragatha, Therigatha:</b> <i>Elders' Verses,</i> prose translation by K.R. Norman (Oxford: <a href="outsources/books.html#pts">Pali Text Society</a>, 1992) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Patisambhidamagga, Buddhavamsa, Cariyapitaka, Nettippakarana, Petakopadesa, Milindapa&ntilde;ha:</b> translations, of varying quality, are available from the <a href="outsources/books.html#pts">PTS</a>.</li>
<li><b>Apadana, Niddesa:</b> I'm unaware of any English translations of these books.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b><a href="tipitaka/abhi/index.html">Abhidhamma Pitaka</a>.</b> The essence of Abhidhamma philosophy is contained in the first and last of the Abhidhamma's seven books; only rarely do scholars and students wade into the murky waters of the middle five. So, begin with these two books:
<ul>
<li><b>Dhammasangani:</b> <i>Buddhist Psychological Ethics,</i> Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids, trans., 3rd ed. (Oxford: Pali Text Society, 1993) [1 vol.]</li>
<li><b>Patthana:</b> <i>Conditional Relations,</i> Ven. U Narada, trans. (Oxford: Pali Text Society, 1993) [2 vols.]</li>
</ul>These books are difficult reading; you'll welcome the sober guidance of the <i>Abhidhammattha Sangaha,</i> a medieval commentary by Acariya Anuruddha. By far the best translation of this work is <i>A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma,</i> translated and edited by Mahathera Narada and Bhikkhu Bodhi (Kandy: <a href="outsources/books.html#bps">Buddhist Publication Society</a>, 1993). [1 vol.]
</li>
</ul>
