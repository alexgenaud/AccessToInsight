<div class="excerpt">
<p>"And what is meant by admirable friendship? There is the case where a lay person, in whatever town or village he may dwell, spends time with householders or householders' sons, young or old, who are advanced in <a href="../../../sila/index.html">virtue</a>. He talks with them, engages them in discussions. He emulates consummate conviction [in the principle of <a href="kamma.html">kamma</a>] in those who are consummate in conviction, consummate <a href="../../../sila/index.html">virtue</a> in those who are consummate in virtue, consummate <a href="../../../dana/index.html">generosity</a> in those who are consummate in generosity, and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment. This is called admirable friendship."</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>"With regard to external factors, I don't envision any other single factor like friendship with admirable people as doing so much for a monk in training, who has not attained the <a href="../../sacca3/nibbana.html">heart's goal</a> but remains intent on the <a href="../../sacca3/nibbana.html">unsurpassed safety from bondage</a>. A monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful."</p>

<p>"These are the four drains on one's store of wealth: being debauched in sex; being debauched in drink; being debauched in gambling; and having evil people as friends, associates, and companions. Just as if there were a great reservoir with four inlets and four drains, and a man were to close the inlets and open the drains, and the sky were not to pour down proper showers, the depletion of that great reservoir could be expected, not its increase. In the same way, these are the four drains on one's store of wealth: being debauched in sex, being debauched in drink, being debauched in gambling, and having evil people as friends, associates, and companions."</p>

<h2><a id='whole' name='whole'>The whole of the holy life</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>As he was sitting there, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy life, lord: admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie."</p>
<p>"Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues, he can be expected to develop &amp; pursue the <a href="../../index.html">noble eightfold path</a>.</p>
<p>"<a name="eightfold" id="eightfold">And how</a> does a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues, develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path? There is the case where a monk develops <a href="../samma-ditthi/index.html">right view</a> dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops <a href="../samma-sankappo/index.html">right resolve</a>...<a href="../samma-vaca/index.html">right speech</a>...<a href="../samma-kammanto/index.html">right action</a>...<a href="../samma-ajivo/index.html">right livelihood</a>...<a href="../samma-vayamo/index.html">right effort</a>...<a href="../samma-sati/index.html">right mindfulness</a>...<a href="../samma-samadhi/index.html">right concentration</a> dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; colleagues, develops &amp; pursues the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>"And through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life: It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair have gained <a href="../../sacca3/nibbana.html">release from sorrow</a>, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how having admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life."</p>

<h2><a id='benefits' name='benefits'>The benefits of admirable friendship</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Meghiya, when a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will be virtuous, will dwell restrained in accordance with the <a href="../../../../../tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html">Patimokkha</a>, consummate in his behavior and sphere of activity, and will train himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.</p>
<p>"When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will, easily and without difficulty, talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness, i.e., talk on modesty, on contentment, on seclusion, on non-entanglement, on arousing persistence, on virtue, on concentration, on discernment, on release, and on the knowledge and vision of release.</p>
<p>"When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities, and for taking on skillful qualities &mdash; steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities.</p>
<p>"When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will be discerning, endowed with discernment of arising and passing away &mdash; noble, penetrating, leading to the <a href="../../sacca3/nibbana.html">right ending of stress</a>."</p>

<p>"[1] The Dhamma should be taught with the thought, 'I will speak step-by-step.'</p>
<p>"[2] The Dhamma should be taught with the thought, 'I will speak explaining the sequence [of cause &amp; effect].'</p>
<p>"[3] The Dhamma should be taught with the thought, 'I will speak out of compassion.'</p>
<p>"[4] The Dhamma should be taught with the thought, 'I will speak not for the purpose of material reward.'</p>

<h2><a id='company' name='company'>Keeping company with the wise</a></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<div class='freeverse'>
It's good to see <a href="../../../../sangha.html">Noble Ones</a>.
Happy their company  &mdash;  always.
Through not seeing fools
constantly, constantly
	one would be happy.

For, living with a fool,
one grieves a long time.
Painful is communion with fools,
as with an enemy  &mdash;
	always.
Happy is communion
with the enlightened,
as with a gathering of kin.

So:
the enlightened man  &mdash;
discerning, learned,
enduring, dutiful, noble,
intelligent, a man of integrity:
	follow him
	&mdash;  one of this sort  &mdash;
	as the moon, the path
	of the zodiac stars.
