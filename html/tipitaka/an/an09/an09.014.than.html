<div class="chapter">
<p>Then Ven. Samiddhi went to <a name="sariputta" id="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</a> and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Ven. Sariputta said to him, "Based on what, Samiddhi, do thoughts &amp; resolves arise in a person?"</p>
<p>"Based on name &amp; form, sir."</p>
<p>"And how do they go to diversity?"</p>
<p>"Through the properties, sir."</p>
<p>"And what do they have as their origination?"</p>
<p>"They have contact as their origination, sir."</p>
<p>"And what do they have as their meeting place?"</p>
<p>"They have feeling as their meeting place, sir."</p>
<p>"And what do they have as their presiding state?"</p>
<p>"They have concentration as their presiding state, sir."</p>
<p>"And what do they have as their governing principle?"</p>
<p>"They have mindfulness as their governing principle, sir."</p>
<p>"And what do they have as their surpassing state?"</p>
<p>"They have discernment as their surpassing state, sir."</p>
<p>"And what do they have as their heartwood?"</p>
<p>"They have release as their heartwood, sir."</p>
<p>"And where do they gain their footing?"</p>
<p>"They gain their footing in the deathless, sir."</p>
<p>"Samiddhi, on being asked, 'Based on what do thoughts &amp; resolves arise in a person?' you have answered, 'Based on name &amp; form.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And how do they go to diversity?' you have answered, 'Through the properties.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And what do they have as their origination?' you have answered, 'They have contact as their origination.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And what do they have as their meeting place?' you have answered, 'They have feeling as their meeting place.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And what do they have as their presiding state?' you have answered, 'They have concentration as their presiding state.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And what do they have as their governing principle?' you have answered, 'They have mindfulness as their governing principle.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And what do they have as their surpassing state?' you have answered, 'They have discernment as their surpassing state.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And what do they have as their heartwood?' you have answered, 'They have release as their heartwood.'</p>
<p>"When asked, 'And where do they gain their footing?' you have answered, 'They gain their footing in the deathless.'</p>
<p>"Very good, Samiddhi, very good. It's good, the way you have answered when questioned, but don't get conceited about that."</p>
