<p><b>Translator's note:</b> The suttas in this section of the Fives are formulaic, and the Canon does not give them names. The following group of suttas deals with the topic of stinginess, and so I have named the group after their topic.</p>

<h3><a name="sutta-254" id="sutta-254">AN 5.254: Macchariya Sutta &mdash; Stinginess (1)</a></h3>
<p>"Monks, there are these five forms of stinginess. Which five? Stinginess as to one's monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to one's family [of supporters], stinginess as to one's gains, stinginess as to one's status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma. These are the five forms of stinginess. And the meanest of these five is this: stinginess as to the Dhamma."</p>

<p>"With the abandoning and eradication of stinginess as to one's monastery [lodgings], the holy life is fulfilled. With the abandoning and eradication of stinginess as to one's family [of supporters] ... stinginess as to one's gains ... stinginess as to one's status ... stinginess as to the Dhamma, the holy life is fulfilled.</p>
