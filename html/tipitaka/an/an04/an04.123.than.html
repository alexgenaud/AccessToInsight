<div class="chapter">
<p>"Monks, there are these <a id="types4" name="types4">four types of individuals</a> to be found existing in the world. Which four?</p>

<p><a id="jhana1" name="jhana1"></a>"There is the case where an individual, withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He savors that, longs for that, finds satisfaction through that. Staying there &mdash; fixed on that, dwelling there often, not falling away from that &mdash; then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the devas of Brahma's retinue. The devas of Brahma's retinue, monks, have a life-span of an eon. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, is unbound right in that state of being. This, monks, is the difference, this the distinction, this the distinguishing factor, between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated run-of-the-mill person, when there is a destination, a reappearing.</p>

<p><a id="jhana2" name="jhana2"></a>"Again, there is the case where an individual, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. He savors that, longs for that, finds satisfaction through that. Staying there &mdash; fixed on that, dwelling there often, not falling away from that &mdash; then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Abhassara<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1' name='fnt-1'>[1]</a> devas.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2' name='fnt-2'>[2]</a> The Abhassara devas, monks, have a life-span of two eons. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, is unbound right in that state of being. This, monks, is the difference, this the distinction, this the distinguishing factor, between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated run-of-the-mill person, when there is a destination, a reappearing.</p>

<p><a id="jhana3" name="jhana3"></a>"Again, there is the case where an individual, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He savors that, longs for that, finds satisfaction through that. Staying there &mdash; fixed on that, dwelling there often, not falling away from that &mdash; then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Subhakinha<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3' name='fnt-3'>[3]</a> devas. The Subhakinha devas, monks, have a life-span of four eons. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, is unbound right in that state of being. This, monks, is the difference, this the distinction, this the distinguishing factor, between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated run-of-the-mill person, when there is a destination, a reappearing.</p>

<p><a id="jhana4" name="jhana4"></a>"Again, there is the case where an individual, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; stress &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He savors that, longs for that, finds satisfaction through that. Staying there &mdash; fixed on that, dwelling there often, not falling away from that &mdash; then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Vehapphala<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4' name='fnt-4'>[4]</a> devas. The Vehapphala devas, monks, have a life-span of 500 eons. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, is unbound right in that state of being. This, monks, is the difference, this the distinction, this the distinguishing factor, between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated run-of-the-mill person, when there is a destination, a reappearing.</p>
