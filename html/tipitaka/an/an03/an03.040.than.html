<div class="chapter">
<p>"There are these three governing principles. Which three? The self as a governing principle, the cosmos as a governing principle, and the Dhamma as a governing principle.</p>
<p>"And what is the self as a governing principle? There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this: 'It is not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness; it is not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of [future] becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness. Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, &amp; death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, [and I hope,] "Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress might be known!" Now, if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness &mdash; or a worse sort &mdash; that would not be fitting for me.' So he reflects on this: 'My persistence will be aroused &amp; not lax; my mindfulness established &amp; not confused; my body calm &amp; not aroused; my mind centered &amp; unified.' Having made himself his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in a pure way. This is called the self as a governing principle.</p>
<p>"<a name="cosmos" id="cosmos">And what</a> is the cosmos as a governing principle? There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this: 'It is not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness; it is not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of [future] becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness. Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, &amp; death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, [and I hope,] "Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress might be known!" Now if I, having gone forth, were to think thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, or thoughts of harmfulness: great is the community of this cosmos. And in the great community of this cosmos there are brahmans &amp; contemplatives endowed with psychic power, clairvoyant, skilled [in reading] the minds of others. They can see even from afar. Even up close, they are invisible. With their awareness they know the minds of others. They would know this of me: "Look, my friends, at this clansman who &mdash; though he has in good faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness &mdash; remains overcome with evil, unskillful mental qualities." There are also devas endowed with psychic power, clairvoyant, skilled [in reading] the minds of others. They can see even from afar. Even up close, they are invisible. With their awareness they know the minds of others. They would know this of me: "Look, my friends, at this clansman who &mdash; though he has in good faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness &mdash; remains overcome with evil, unskillful mental qualities."' So he reflects on this: 'My persistence will be aroused &amp; not lax; my mindfulness established &amp; not confused; my body calm &amp; not aroused; my mind centered &amp; unified.' Having made the cosmos his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in a pure way. This is called the cosmos as a governing principle.</p>
<p>"<a name="dhamma" id="dhamma">And what</a> is the Dhamma as a governing principle? There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this: 'It is not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness; it is not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of [future] becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness. Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, &amp; death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, [and I hope,] "Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress might be known!" Now, the Dhamma is well-taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting all to come &amp; see, pertinent, to be seen by the wise for themselves. There are fellow practitioners of the chaste life who dwell knowing &amp; seeing it. If I &mdash; having gone forth in this well-taught Dhamma &amp; Vinaya &mdash; were to remain lazy &amp; heedless, that would not be fitting for me.' So he reflects on this: 'My persistence will be aroused &amp; not lax; my mindfulness established &amp; not confused; my body calm &amp; not aroused; my mind centered &amp; unified.' Having made the Dhamma his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in a pure way. This is called the Dhamma as a governing principle.</p>
<p>"These are the three governing principles."</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
There is
in the cosmos
	       no
	       secret
	       place
for one
who has done
	       an
	       evil
	       deed.

Your own self knows, my good man,
whether you are true
	       or false.
You underestimate the fine witness
	that is yourself,
you with evil
	in yourself
that then you hide.

The devas &amp; Tathagatas see the fool
	who goes about
	out of tune with the cosmos.

Thus you should go about
self-governed,
	       mindful;
governed by the cosmos,
	       masterful,
	       absorbed in jhana;
governed by the Dhamma,
	       acting in line
	       with the Dhamma.

The sage who makes an effort
	   in truth
	   doesn't fall back.

Whoever through striving
	&mdash;  overpowering Mara,
	conquering the Ender  &mdash;
touches the stopping of birth,
is      Such,
	   a knower of the cosmos,
	   wise,
a sage
	   unfashioned
	   with regard to all things.
