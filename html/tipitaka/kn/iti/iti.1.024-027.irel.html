<h2>&sect; 24. A Heap of Bones <span class='altID'>{Iti 1.24; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.017' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 17</a>}</span> &nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top' name='iti-024' id='iti-024'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.1.001-027.than.html#iti-024">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, the skeletons of a single person, running on and wandering in samsara for an aeon, would make a heap of bones, a quantity of bones as large as this Mount Vepulla, if there were someone to collect them and if the collection were not destroyed."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
The bones of a single person
Accumulated in a single aeon
Would make a heap like a mountain &mdash;
So said the Great Sage.

He declared it to be
As great as Mount Vepulla
To the north of Vulture's Peak
In the hill-fort of Magadha.

But when one sees with perfect wisdom
The four noble truths as they are &mdash;
Suffering, the origin of suffering,
The overcoming of suffering,
And the noble eightfold path
Leading to relief from suffering &mdash; 

Having merely run on
Seven times at the most,
By destroying all fetters
One makes an end of suffering.

<h2>&sect; 25. Lying <span class='altID'>{Iti 1.25; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.018' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 18</a>}</span> &nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top' name='iti-025' id='iti-025'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.1.001-027.than.html#iti-025">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, I say that for an individual who transgresses in one thing, there is no evil deed whatsoever he would not do. What is that one thing? It is this, bhikkhus: deliberately telling a lie."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
There is no evil that cannot be done
By a person who deliberately lies,
Who transgresses in one thing,
Taking no account of the next world.
</div>

<h2>&sect; 26. Giving <span class='altID'>{Iti 1.26; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.018' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 18</a>}</span> &nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top' name='iti-026' id='iti-026'>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.1.001-027.than.html#iti-026">Thanissaro</a>]</span>


<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, if beings knew, as I know, the result of giving and sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would they allow the stain of meanness to obsess them and take root in their minds. Even if it were their last morsel, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared it, if there were someone to share it with. But, bhikkhus, as beings do not know, as I know, the result of giving and sharing, they eat without having given, and the stain of meanness obsesses them and takes root in their minds."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
If beings only knew &mdash;
So said the Great Sage &mdash;
How the result of sharing
Is of such great fruit,
With a gladdened mind,
Rid of the stain of meanness,
They would duly give to noble ones
Who make what is given fruitful.

Having given much food as offerings
To those most worthy of offerings,
The donors go to heaven
On departing the human state.
Having gone to heaven they rejoice,
And enjoying pleasures there,
The unselfish experience the result
Of generously sharing with others.

<h2>&sect; 27. The Development of Loving-kindness <span class='altID'>{Iti 1.27; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.019' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 19</a>}</span> &nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top' name='iti-027' id='iti-027'>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.1.001-027.than.html#iti-027">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness. The mind-release of loving-kindness surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant.</p>
<p>"Just as the radiance of all the stars does not equal a sixteenth part of the moon's radiance, but the moon's radiance surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness...</p>
<p>"Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when the sky is clear and free of clouds, the sun, on ascending, dispels the darkness of space and shines forth, bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness...</p>
<p>"And just as in the night, at the moment of dawn, the morning star shines forth, bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness. The mind-release of loving-kindness surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
For one who mindfully develops
Boundless loving-kindness
Seeing the destruction of clinging,
The fetters are worn away.

If with an uncorrupted mind
He pervades just one being
With loving kindly thoughts,
He makes some merit thereby.

But a noble one produces
An abundance of merit
By having a compassionate mind
Towards all living beings.

Those royal seers who conquered
The earth crowded with beings
Went about performing sacrifices:
The horse sacrifice, the man sacrifice,
The water rites, the soma sacrifice,
And that called "the Unobstructed."

But these do not share even a sixteenth part
Of a well cultivated mind of love,
Just as the entire starry host
Is dimmed by the moon's radiance.

One who does not kill
Nor cause others to kill,
Who does not conquer
Nor cause others to conquer,
Kindly towards all beings &mdash;
He has enmity for none.
</div>

<p>This too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord, so I heard.</p>
