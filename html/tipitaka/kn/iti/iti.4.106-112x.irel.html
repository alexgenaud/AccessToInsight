<h2>&sect; 106. With Brahma <span class='altID'>{Iti 4.7; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.109' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 109</a>}</span> &nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top' name='iti-106' id='iti-106'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.4.100-112.than.html#iti-106">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Living with Brahma are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. Living with the early devas are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. Living with the early teachers are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. Living with those worthy of adoration are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. 'Brahma,' bhikkhus, is a term for mother and father. 'Early devas' and 'early teachers' and 'those worthy of veneration' are terms for mother and father. For what reason? Because mother and father are very helpful to their children, they take care of them and bring them up and teach them about the world."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Mother and father are called
"Brahma," "early teachers"
And "worthy of veneration,"
Being compassionate towards
Their family of children.

Thus the wise should venerate them,
Pay them due honor,
Provide them with food and drink,
Give them clothing and a bed,
Anoint and bathe them
And also wash their feet.

When he performs such service
For his mother and his father,
They praise that wise person even here
And hereafter he rejoices in heaven

<h2>&sect; 109. The River Current <span class='altID'>{Iti 4.10; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.114' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 114</a>}</span> &nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top' name='iti-109' id='iti-109'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.4.100-112.than.html#iti-109">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord...</p>
<p>"Suppose, bhikkhus, a man was being borne along by the current of a river that seemed pleasant and agreeable. But upon seeing him, a keen-sighted man standing on the bank would call out to him: 'Hey, good man! Although you are being borne along by the current of a river that seems pleasant and agreeable, lower down there is a pool with turbulent waves and swirling eddies, with monsters and demons. On reaching that pool you will die or suffer close to death.' Then, bhikkhus, upon hearing the words of that person, that man would struggle against the current with hands and feet.</p>
<p>"I have made use of this simile, bhikkhus, to illustrate the meaning. And this is the meaning here: 'The current of the river' is a synonym for craving. 'Seeming pleasant and agreeable' is a synonym for the six internal sense-bases. 'The pool lower down' is a synonym for the five lower fetters. 'Turbulent waves' is a synonym for anger and frustration. 'Swirling eddies' is a synonym for the five strands of sensual pleasure. 'Monsters and demons' is a synonym for womenfolk. 'Against the current' is a synonym for renunciation. 'Struggling with hands and feet' is a synonym for instigating energy. 'The keen-sighted man standing on the bank' is a synonym for the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Desiring future security from bondage
One should abandon sensual desire
However painful this may be.
Rightly comprehending with wisdom,
Possessing a mind that is well released,
One may reach freedom step by step.

One who is a master of knowledge,
Who has lived the holy life,
Is called one gone to the world's end,
One who has reached the further shore.

<h2>&sect; 112. The World <span class='altID'>{Iti 4.13; <a href='./../../../tipitaka/sltp/It_utf8.html#pts.121' title='Read the Pali source' target='pali'>Iti 121</a>}</span> &nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top' name='iti-112' id='iti-112'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<span class='altTrans'>[Alternate translation: <a href="iti.4.100-112.than.html#iti-112">Thanissaro</a>]</span>

<p>This was said by the Lord, said by the Arahant, so I heard:</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata; the Tathagata is released from the world. The origin of the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata; the origin of the world has been abandoned by the Tathagata. The cessation of the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata; the cessation of the world has been realized by the Tathagata. The course leading to the cessation of the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata; the course leading to the cessation of the world has been developed by the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, in the world with its devas, maras, and brahmas, with its recluses and brahmans, among humankind with its princes and people, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought, and reflected upon by the mind &mdash; that is fully understood by the Tathagata: therefore he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, from the night when the Tathagata awakened to unsurpassed full enlightenment until the night when he passes away into the Nibbana-element with no residue left, whatever he speaks, utters, and explains &mdash; all that is just so and not otherwise: therefore he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"As the Tathagata says, so he does; as the Tathagata does, so he says: therefore he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"In the world with its devas, maras, and brahmas, with its recluses and brahmans, among humankind with its princes and people, the Tathagata is the conqueror, unvanquished, all-seer, wielding power: therefore he is called the Tathagata."</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
By knowledge of the whole world,
The whole world as it truly is,
He is released from all the world,
In all the world he is unattached.

The all-conquering heroic sage,
Freed from every bond is he;
He has reached that perfect peace,
Nibbana which is free from fear.

Rid of taints, he is enlightened,
Trouble-free, with doubts destroyed,
Reached the final end of deeds,
Released by clinging's full destruction.

The Enlightened One, the Lord,
A lion is he, unsurpassed;
For in the world together with its devas
He set the Brahma-wheel in motion.

Thus those devas and human beings,
Gone for refuge to the Buddha,
On meeting him pay homage to him,
The great one free from diffidence.

Tamed, of the tamed he is the best;
Calmed, of the calmed he is the seer;
Freed, of the freed he is the foremost;
Crossed, of the crossed he is the chief.

Thus do they pay him due homage,
The great one free from diffidence:
"In the world together with its devas
There is no person equalling you."
</div>

<p>This too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord, so I heard.</p>
