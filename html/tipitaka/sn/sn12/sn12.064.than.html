<div class="chapter">
<p>At <a name="savatthi" id="savatthi">Savatthi</a>... "There are these <a name="nutriments4" id="nutriments4">four nutriments</a> for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born. Which four? Physical food, gross or refined; contact as the second, intellectual intention <!--{BB: mental volition}--> the third, and consciousness the fourth. These are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born.</p>
<p>"Where there is passion, delight, &amp; craving for the nutriment of physical food, consciousness lands there and increases. Where consciousness lands and increases, there is the alighting of name-&amp;-form. Where there is the alighting of name-&amp;-form, there is the growth of fabrications. Where there is the growth of fabrications, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging, &amp; death, together, I tell you, with sorrow, affliction, &amp; despair.</p>
<p>"Where there is passion, delight, &amp; craving for the nutriment of contact...</p>
<p>"Where there is passion, delight, &amp; craving for the nutriment of intellectual intention...</p>
<p>"Where there is passion, delight, &amp; craving for the nutriment of consciousness, consciousness lands there and increases. Where consciousness lands and increases, there is the alighting of name-&amp;-form. Where there is the alighting of name-&amp;-form, there is the growth of fabrications. Where there is the growth of fabrications, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging, &amp; death, together, I tell you, with sorrow, affliction, &amp; despair.</p>
<p>"<a name="picture" id="picture">Just as</a> &mdash; when there is dye, lac, yellow orpiment, indigo, or crimson &mdash; a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man, complete in all its parts, on a well-polished panel or wall, or on a piece of cloth; in the same way, where there is passion, delight, &amp; craving for the nutriment of physical food... contact... intellectual intention... consciousness, consciousness lands there and increases. Where consciousness lands and increases, there is the alighting of name-&amp;-form. Where there is the alighting of name-&amp;-form, there is the growth of fabrications. Where there is the growth of fabrications, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging, &amp; death, together, I tell you, with sorrow, affliction, &amp; despair.</p>
<p>"Where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food, where there is no delight, no craving, then consciousness does not land there or increase. Where consciousness does not land or increase, there is no alighting of name-&amp;-form. Where there is no alighting of name-&amp;-form, there is no growth of fabrications. Where there is no growth of fabrications, there is no production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no future birth, aging, &amp; death. That, I tell you, has no sorrow, affliction, or despair.</p>
<p>"Where there is no passion for the nutriment of contact...</p>
<p>"Where there is no passion for the nutriment of intellectual intention...</p>
<p>"Where there is no passion for the nutriment of consciousness, where there is no delight, no craving, then consciousness does not land there or increase. Where consciousness does not land or increase, there is no alighting of name-&amp;-form. Where there is no alighting of name-&amp;-form, there is no growth of fabrications. Where there is no growth of fabrications, there is no production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no future birth, aging, &amp; death. That, I tell you, has no sorrow, affliction, or despair.</p>
<p>"<a name="house" id="house">Just as</a> if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north, the south, or the east. When the sun rises, and a ray has entered by way of the window, where does it land?"</p>
<p>"On the western wall, lord."</p>
<p>"And if there is no western wall, where does it land?"</p>
<p>"On the ground, lord."</p>
<p>"And if there is no ground, where does it land?"</p>
<p>"On the water, lord."</p>
<p>"And if there is no water, where does it land?"</p>
<p>"It does not land, lord."</p>
<p>"In the same way, where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food... contact... intellectual intention... consciousness, where there is no delight, no craving, then consciousness does not land there or increase. Where consciousness does not land or increase, there is no alighting of name-&amp;-form. Where there is no alighting of name-&amp;-form, there is no growth of fabrications. Where there is no growth of fabrications, there is no production of renewed becoming in the future. Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no future birth, aging, &amp; death. That, I tell you, has no sorrow, affliction, or despair."</p>
