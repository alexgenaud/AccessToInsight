<h2><a id="rewards">The rewards of giving</a></h2>
	<div class="excerpt">
<p>"These are the five rewards of generosity: One is dear and appealing to people at large, one is admired by good people, one's good name is spread about, one does not stray from the rightful duties of the householder, and with the break-up of the body at death, one reappears in a good destination, in the <a href="../sagga/index.html">heavenly worlds</a>."</p>

	<div class="excerpt">
<p>[The Buddha:] "Then there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life, refrains from taking what is not given, refrains from sensual misconduct, refrains from false speech, refrains from divisive speech, refrains from abusive speech, refrains from idle chatter, is not covetous, bears no ill will, and has right views. And he gives food, drink, cloth, vehicles, garlands, scents, creams, bed, lodging, &amp; lamps to brahmans &amp; contemplatives. With the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of human beings. There he experiences the five strings of human sensuality [delightful sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations]. It's because he refrained from taking what is not given, refrained from sensual misconduct, refrained from false speech, refrained from divisive speech, refrained from abusive speech, refrained from idle chatter, was not covetous, bore no ill will, and had right views that he reappears in the company of human beings. And it's because he gave food, drink, cloth, vehicles, garlands, scents, creams, bed, lodging, &amp; lamps to brahmans &amp; contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of human sensuality.</p>
<p>[Similarly for the case of rebirth in the company of devas] "...It's because he refrained from taking what is not given... and had right views that he reappears in the company of devas. And it's because he gave food, drink, cloth, vehicles, garlands, scents, creams, bed, lodging, &amp; lamps to brahmans &amp; contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of divine sensuality. But at any rate, brahman, the donor does not go without reward."</p>
<p>[The brahman Janussonin:] "It's amazing, Master Gotama, it's astounding, how it's enough to make one want to give a gift, enough to make one want to make an offering, where the donor does not go without reward."</p>
<p>"That's the way it is, brahman. That's the way it is. The donor does not go without reward."</p>

And the virtuous person has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five.</p>
<p>"Which five has he abandoned? He has abandoned sensual desire... ill will... sloth &amp; drowsiness... restlessness &amp; anxiety... uncertainty. These are the five factors he has abandoned.

<p>[General Siha:] "Is it possible, lord, to point out a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now?"</p>
<p>[The Buddha:] "It is possible, Siha. One who gives, who is a master of giving, is dear &amp; charming to people at large. And the fact that who gives, who is a master of giving, is dear &amp; charming to people at large: this is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, good people, people of integrity, admire one who gives, who is a master of giving. And the fact that good people, people of integrity, admire one who gives, who is a master of giving: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the fine reputation of one who gives, who is a master of giving, is spread far &amp; wide. And the fact that the fine reputation of one who gives, who is a master of giving, is spread far &amp; wide: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, when one who gives, who is a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people &mdash; noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives &mdash; he/she does so confidently &amp; without embarrassment. And the fact that when one who gives, who is a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people &mdash; noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives &mdash; he/she does so confidently &amp; without embarrassment: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, at the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world. And the fact that at the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the <a href="../sagga/index.html">heavenly world</a>: this is a fruit of generosity in the next life."</p>
<p>When this was said, General Siha said to the Blessed One: "As for the four fruits of generosity visible in the here &amp; now that have been pointed out by the Blessed One, it's not the case that I go by conviction in the Blessed One with regard to them. I know them, too. I am one who gives, a master of giving, dear &amp; charming to people at large. I am one who gives, a master of giving; good people, people of integrity, admire me. I am one who gives, a master of giving, and my fine reputation is spread far &amp; wide: 'Siha is generous, a doer, a supporter of the Sangha.' I am one who gives, a master of giving, and when I approach any assembly of people &mdash; noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives &mdash; I do so confidently &amp; without embarrassment.</p>
<p>"But when the Blessed One says to me, 'At the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world,' that I do not know. That is where I go by conviction in the Blessed One."</p>
<p>"So it is, Siha. So it is. At the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>
