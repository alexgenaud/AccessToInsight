<p>In <a href="loka.html">Buddhist cosmology</a>, the heaven realms are blissful abodes whose present inhabitants (the <i>devas)</i> gained rebirth there through the power of their past meritorious <a href="../sacca/sacca4/samma-ditthi/kamma.html">actions</a>. Like all beings still caught in <i><a href="../sacca/sacca1/samsara.html">samsara</a>,</i> however, these deities eventually succumb to aging, illness, and death, and must eventually take rebirth in other realms &mdash; pleasant or otherwise &mdash; according to the quality and strength of their past <i><a href="../sacca/sacca4/samma-ditthi/kamma.html">kamma</a>.</i> The devas are not always especially knowledgable or spiritually mature &mdash; in fact many are quite intoxicated by their sensual indulgences &mdash; and none are considered worthy of veneration or worship. Nevertheless, the devas and their happy realms stand as important reminders to us both of the happy benefits that ensue from the performance of skillful and meritorious deeds and, finally, of the ultimate <a href="../adinava/index.html">shortcomings of sensuality</a>.</p>

	

	
<h2>A rare rebirth</h2>

Blinded this world  &mdash;

<h2>Seeing for oneself</h2>
	<div class="excerpt">
<p>"I have seen beings who &mdash; endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, &amp; mental good conduct; who did not revile <a href="../../sangha.html">Noble Ones</a>, who held <a href="../sacca/sacca4/samma-ditthi/index.html">right views</a> and undertook <a href="../sacca/sacca4/samma-ditthi/kamma.html">actions</a> under the influence of right views &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destination, the heavenly world. It is not from having heard this from other brahmans &amp; contemplatives that I tell you that I have seen beings who &mdash; endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, &amp; mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destination, the heavenly world. It is from having known it myself, seen it myself, realized it myself that I tell you that I have seen beings who &mdash; endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, &amp; mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destination, the heavenly world."</p>

<h2>Recollecting the devas</h2>
	<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Furthermore, you should recollect the devas: 'There are the devas of the Four Great Kings, the devas of the Thirty-three, the devas of the Hours, the Contented Devas, the devas who delight in creation, the devas who have power over the creations of others, the devas of Brahma's retinue, the devas beyond them. Whatever conviction they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of conviction is present in me as well. Whatever <a href="../sila/index.html">virtue</a> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of virtue is present in me as well. Whatever learning they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of learning is present in me as well. Whatever <a href="../dana/index.html">generosity</a> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of generosity is present in me as well. Whatever <a href="../index.html#panna">discernment</a> they were endowed with that &mdash; when falling away from this life &mdash; they re-arose there, the same sort of discernment is present in me as well.' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the conviction, virtue, learning, generosity, and discernment found both in himself and the devas, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the [qualities of the] devas. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the <a href="../sacca/sacca3/nibbana.html">goal</a>, gains a sense of the <a href="../index.html">Dhamma</a>, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed experiences ease. In one at ease, the mind becomes <a href="../sacca/sacca4/samma-samadhi/index.html">concentrated</a>."</p>

<h2>Happy, but of limited wisdom</h2>
	<div class="excerpt">
<p>"Once, Kevatta, this train of thought arose in the awareness of a certain monk in this very community of monks: 'Where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?' Then he attained to such a state of <a href="../sacca/sacca4/samma-samadhi/index.html">concentration</a> that the way leading to the gods appeared in his centered mind. So he approached the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; <a href="../sacca/sacca3/nibbana.html">cease without remainder</a>?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there are the Four Great Kings who are higher and more sublime than us. They should know where the four great elements... cease without remainder.'</p>
<p>"So the monk approached the Four Great Kings and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements... cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the Four Great Kings said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there are the gods of the Thirty-three who are higher and more sublime than us. They should know...'</p>
<p>"So the monk approached the gods of the Thirty-three... Sakka... the Yama gods... Santusita... the Nimmanarati gods... Sunimmita... the Paranimmitavasavatti gods... Paranimmita Vasavatti... the gods of the retinue of Brahma...</p>
<p>"Then the monk attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods of the retinue of Brahma appeared in his centered mind. So he approached the gods of the retinue of Brahma and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the gods of the retinue of Brahma said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there is <a id="brahma2">Brahma</a>, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He is higher and more sublime than we. He should know...'</p>
<p>"'But where, friends, is the Great Brahma now?'</p>
<p>"'Monk, we also don't know where Brahma is or in what way Brahma is. But when signs appear, light shines forth, and a radiance appears, Brahma will appear. For these are the portents of Brahma's appearance: light shines forth and a radiance appears.'</p>
<p>"Then it was not long before Brahma appeared.</p>
<p>"So the monk approached the Great Brahma and, on arrival, said, 'Friend, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.'</p>
<p>"A second time, the monk said to the Great Brahma, 'Friend, I didn't ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder.'</p>
<p>"A second time, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.'</p>
<p>"A third time...</p>
<p>"Then the Great Brahma, taking the monk by the arm and leading him off to one side, said to him, 'These gods of the retinue of Brahma believe, "There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not know. There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not see. There is nothing of which the Great Brahma is unaware. There is nothing that the Great Brahma has not realized." That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However he answers it, you should take it to heart.'</p>
<p>"Then &mdash; just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm &mdash; the monk disappeared from the Brahma world and immediately appeared in front of me. Having bowed down to me, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to me, 'Venerable sir, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, I said to him, 'Once, monk, some sea-faring merchants took a shore-sighting bird and set sail in their ship. When they could not see the shore, they released the shore-sighting bird. It flew to the east, south, west, north, straight up, and to all the intermediate points of the compass. If it saw the shore in any direction, it flew there. If it did not see the shore in any direction, it returned right back to the ship. In the same way, monk, having gone as far as the Brahma world in search of an answer to your question, you have come right back to my presence.'"</p>
