<h2>Sariputta's elaboration</h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p><i>[Ven. Sariputta:]</i> "Now what, friends, is the noble truth of stress? Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful; separation from the loved is stressful; not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>birth?</i> Whatever birth, taking birth, descent, coming-to-be, coming-forth, appearance of aggregates, &amp; acquisition of [sense] spheres of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called birth.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>aging?</i> Whatever aging, decrepitude, brokenness, graying, wrinkling, decline of life-force, weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called aging.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>death?</i> Whatever deceasing, passing away, breaking up, disappearance, dying, death, completion of time, break up of the aggregates, casting off of the body, interruption in the life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called death.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>sorrow?</i> Whatever sorrow, sorrowing, sadness, inward sorrow, inward sadness of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that is called sorrow.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>lamentation?</i> Whatever crying, grieving, lamenting, weeping, wailing, lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that is called lamentation.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>pain?</i> Whatever is experienced as bodily pain, bodily discomfort, pain or discomfort born of bodily contact, that is called pain.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>distress?</i> Whatever is experienced as mental pain, mental discomfort, pain or discomfort born of mental contact, that is called distress.</p>
<p>"And what is <i>despair?</i> Whatever despair, despondency, desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that is called despair.</p>
<p>"And what is the stress of <i>association with the unbeloved?</i> There is the case where undesirable, unpleasing, unattractive sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, or tactile sensations occur to one; or one has connection, contact, relationship, interaction with those who wish one ill, who wish for one's harm, who wish for one's discomfort, who wish one no security from the yoke. This is called the stress of association with the unbeloved.</p>
<p>"And what is the stress of <i>separation from the loved?</i> There is the case where desirable, pleasing, attractive sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, or tactile sensations do not occur to one; or one has no connection, no contact, no relationship, no interaction with those who wish one well, who wish for one's benefit, who wish for one's comfort, who wish one security from the yoke, nor with one's mother, father, brother, sister, friends, companions, or relatives. This is called the stress of separation from the loved.</p>
<p>"And what is the stress of <i>not getting what is wanted?</i> In beings subject to birth, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to birth, and may birth not come to us.' But this is not to be achieved by wanting. This is the stress of not getting what is wanted. In beings subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair, and may aging... illness... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair not come to us.' But this is not to be achieved by wanting. This is the stress of not getting what is wanted.</p>
<p>"And what are the <i>five clinging-aggregates</i> that, in short, are stressful? The clinging-aggregate of form, the clinging-aggregate of feeling, the clinging-aggregate of perception, the clinging-aggregate of fabrications, the clinging-aggregate of consciousness: These are called the five clinging-aggregates that, in short, are stressful.</p>
<p>"This, friends, is called the noble truth of stress.</p>

<h2>Defined in terms of the senses</h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"And what is the noble truth of dukkha? 'The six internal sense media,' should be the reply. Which six? The medium of the eye... the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the intellect. This is called the noble truth of dukkha."</p>

<h2>Dukkha as a raging fire</h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"The All is aflame. What All is aflame? The eye is aflame. Forms are aflame. Consciousness at the eye is aflame. Contact at the eye is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye &mdash; experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain &mdash; that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging &amp; death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs.</p>
<p>"The ear is aflame. Sounds are aflame...</p>
<p>"The nose is aflame. Aromas are aflame...</p>
<p>"The tongue is aflame. Flavors are aflame...</p>
<p>"The body is aflame. Tactile sensations are aflame...</p>
<p>"The intellect is aflame. Ideas are aflame. Consciousness at the intellect is aflame. Contact at the intellect is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect &mdash; experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain &mdash; that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I say, with birth, aging &amp; death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs."</p>

<h2>Dukkha should be <i>known</i></h2>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>"'Dukkha should be known. The cause by which dukkha comes into play should be known. The diversity in dukkha should be known. The result of dukkha should be known. The cessation of dukkha should be known. The path of practice for the cessation of dukkha should be known.' Thus it has been said. In reference to what was it said?</p>
<p>"Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, death is dukkha; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are dukkha; association with what is not loved is dukkha, separation from what is loved is dukkha, not getting what is wanted is dukkha. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are dukkha.</p>
<p>"And what is the cause by which dukkha comes into play? <a href="../sacca2/tanha.html">Craving</a> is the cause by which dukkha comes into play.</p>
<p>"And what is the diversity in dukkha? There is major dukkha &amp; minor, slowly fading &amp; quickly fading. This is called the diversity in dukkha.</p>
<p>"And what is the result of dukkha? There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, &amp; becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?' I tell you, monks, that dukkha results either in bewilderment or in search. This is called the result of dukkha.</p>
<p>"And what is the cessation of dukkha? From the cessation of <a href="../sacca2/tanha.html">craving</a> is the cessation of dukkha; and just this <a href="../sacca4/index.html">noble eightfold path</a> &mdash; <a href="../sacca4/samma-ditthi/index.html">right view</a>, <a href="../sacca4/samma-sankappo/index.html">right resolve</a>, <a href="../sacca4/samma-vaca/index.html">right speech</a>, <a href="../sacca4/samma-kammanto/index.html">right action</a>, <a href="../sacca4/samma-ajivo/index.html">right livelihood</a>, <a href="../sacca4/samma-vayamo/index.html">right effort</a>, <a href="../sacca4/samma-sati/index.html">right mindfulness</a>, <a href="../sacca4/samma-samadhi/index.html">right concentration</a> &mdash; is the path of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha.</p>
<p>"Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns dukkha in this way, the cause by which dukkha comes into play in this way, the diversity of dukkha in this way, the result of dukkha in this way, the cessation of dukkha in this way, &amp; the path of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of dukkha."</p>
